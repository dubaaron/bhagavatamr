Dhanvantari, Ṛṣabhadeva, Yajña, Balarāma, Vyāsadeva, Buddhadeva and Keśava. One should also think of Govinda, the master of Vṛndāvana. and one should think of Nārāyaṇa, the master of the spiritual sky. One should think of Madhusūdana, Tridhāmā, Mādhava, Hṛṣīkeśa, Padmanābha, Janārdana, Dāmodara and Viśveśvara, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa Himself. After offering prayers to the Lord’s personal expansions known as the <span class="Italic">svāṁśa</span> and <span class="Italic">śaktyāveśa-avatāras,</span> one should pray to the weapons of Lord Nārāyaṇa, such as the Sudarśana, <span class="Italic">gadā, śaṅkha, khaḍga</span> and bow.</div>

            Viśvarūpa said: If some form of fear arrives, one should first wash his hands and legs clean and then perform ācamana by chanting this mantra: oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato ’pi vā/ yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bahyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ/ śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu. Then one should touch kuśa grass and sit gravely and silently, facing north. When completely purified, one should touch the mantra composed of eight syllables to the eight parts of his body and touch the mantra composed of twelve syllables to his hands. Thus, in the following manner, he should bind himself with the Nārāyaṇa coat of armor. First, while chanting the mantra composed of eight syllables [oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya], beginning with the praṇava, the syllable oṁ, one should touch his hands to eight parts of his body, starting with the two feet and progressing systematically to the knees, thighs, abdomen, heart, chest, mouth and head. Then one should chant the mantra in reverse, beginning from the last syllable [ya], while touching the parts of his body in the reverse order. These two processes are known as utpatti-nyāsa and saṁhāra-nyāsa respectively.

            Then one should chant the mantra composed of twelve syllables [oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya]. Preceding each syllable by the oṁkāra, one should place the syllables of the mantra on the tips of his fingers, beginning with the index finger of the right hand and concluding with the index finger of the left. The four remaining syllables should be placed on the joints of the thumbs.

            One must then chant the mantra of six syllables [oṁ viṣṇave namaḥ]. One should place the syllable “oṁ” on his heart, the syllable “vi” on the top of his head, the syllable “ṣa” between his eyebrows, the syllable “ṇa” on his tuft of hair [śikhā], and the syllable “ve” between his eyes. The chanter of the mantra should then place the syllable “na” on all the joints of his body and meditate on the syllable “ma” as being a weapon. He should thus become the perfect personification of the mantra. Thereafter, adding visarga to the final syllable “ma,” he should chant the mantra “maḥ astrāya phaṭ” in all directions, beginning from the east. In this way, all directions will be bound by the protective armor of the mantra.

Understanding that as a spirit soul he is equal in quality to the supreme soul the way the water of a river is of the same nature as the water of the sea, one should meditate upon the Supreme Lord, as described in this verse, and seek His protection. The living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme. Consequently their duty is to always seek the mercy of the Lord in order to be protected by Him in all circumstances.

            Lusty desires are very strong in everyone, and they are the greatest impediment to the discharge of devotional service. Therefore those who are very much influenced by lusty desires are advised to take shelter of Sanat-kumāra, the great <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> devotee. Nārada Muni, who is the guide for <span class="Italic">arcana,</span> is the author of the <span class="Italic">Nārada-pañcarātra,</span> which prescribes the regulative principles for worshiping the Deity.

            To live within this material world, one must face many dangers, as described herein. For example, undesirable food poses a danger to health, and therefore one must give up such food. The Dhanvantari incarnation can protect us in this regard.

Lord Balarāma is the Śeṣa incarnation, and therefore He can save us from angry serpents or envious persons, who are always ready to attack.

            This verse mentions various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appear for various purposes. Śrīla Vyāsadeva, Mahāmuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human society. If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even in this age of Kali, one may consult the books left by Śrīla Vyāsadeva, <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads, Vedānta-sūtra</span> (<span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra</span>), <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam Mahā-Purāṇa</span> (Vyāsadeva’s commentary on the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra</span>) and the other seventeen <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span> Only by the mercy of Śrīla Vyāsadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental knowledge to save us from the clutches of ignorance.

            As described by Śrīla Jayadeva Gosvāmī in his <span class="Italic">Daśāvatāra-stotra,</span> Lord Buddha apparently decried the Vedic knowledge:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātaṁ<br>sadaya-hṛdaya-darśita-paśu-ghātam<br>keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagad-īśa hare</div>

          </p>
          <p>
            The mission of Lord Buddha was to save people from the abominable activity of animal killing and to save the poor animals from being unnecessarily killed. When <span class="Italic">pāṣaṇḍīs</span> were cheating by killing animals on the plea of sacrificing them in Vedic <span class="Italic">yajñas,</span> the Lord said, “If the Vedic injunctions allow animal killing, I do not accept the Vedic principles.” Thus he actually saved people who acted according to Vedic principles. One should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid misusing the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kalki <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> is the fierce incarnation who vanquishes the class of the atheists born in this age of Kali. Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga advances, many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people will forget the real religious principles enunciated by Lord Kṛṣṇa before the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion are actually opposed to the Vedic principles. Every day they manufacture a new type of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> on the plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation. Atheistic men generally say, <span class="Italic">yata mata tata patha.</span> According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle. This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious principles mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kali-yuga progresses. In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Keśava, will descend to kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord.

            A person highly elevated in spiritual knowledge knows that nothing exists but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.4) where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam,</span> indicating that everything we see is an expansion of His energy. This is confirmed in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> (1.22.52):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">ekadeśa-sthitasyāgner<br>jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā<br>parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis<br>tathedam akhilaṁ jagat</div>

            As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat everywhere, so the omnipotent Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself everywhere, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies. Since both cause and effect are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between cause and effect. Consequently the ornaments and weapons of the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different from Him. There is no difference between the Lord and His variously presented energies. This is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś<br>caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ<br>pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto<br>’bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ</div>

          </p>
          <p>
            The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially. The word <span class="Italic">pūrṇa</span> means “complete.” The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from material contamination. The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the Lord is not false, for they are as good as the Lord. Since the Lord is all-pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him. Therefore even worship of the Lord’s weapons or ornaments has the same potency as worship of the Lord. Māyāvādīs refuse to accept the form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> or false, but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable. Although the Lord’s original form and His impersonal expansion are one, the Lord maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally. Therefore this prayer says, <span class="Italic">pātu sarvaiḥ svarūpair naḥ sadā sarvatra sama-gaḥ:</span> “May the Lord, who is all-pervasive in His various forms, protect us everywhere.” The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form, qualities, attributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the devotees. Śrīla Madhvācārya explains this as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            Suddenly Citraratha was forced to fall from the sky headfirst with his airplane. Struck with wonder, he was ordered by the great sages named the Vālikhilyas to throw the brāhmaṇa’s bones in the nearby River Sarasvatī. He had to do this and bathe in the river before returning to his own abode.

            King Indra, who performed one hundred sacrifices, received this prayer of protection from Viśvarūpa. After conquering the demons, he enjoyed all the opulences of the three worlds.

            This mystical mantric armor given by Viśvarūpa to Indra, the King of heaven, acted powerfully, with the effect that Indra was able to conquer the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and enjoy the opulence of the three worlds without impediments. In this regard, Madhvācārya points out:

            One must receive all kinds of <span class="Italic">mantras</span> from a bona fide spiritual master; otherwise the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> will not be fruitful. This is also indicated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.34):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br>paripraśnena sevayā<br>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ</div>

            “Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” All <span class="Italic">mantras</span> should be received through the authorized <span class="Italic">guru,</span> and the disciple must satisfy the <span class="Italic">guru</span> in all respects, after surrendering at his lotus feet. In the <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa</span> it is also said, <span class="Italic">sampradāya-vihīnā ye mantrās te niṣphalā matāḥ.</span> There are four <span class="Italic">sampradāyas,</span> or disciplic successions, namely the Brahma-sampradāya, the Rudra-sampradāya, the Śrī sampradāya and the Kumāra-sampradāya. If one wants to advance in spiritual power, one must receive his <span class="Italic">mantras</span> from one of these bona fide <span class="Italic">sampradāyas;</span> otherwise he will never successfully advance in spiritual life.
