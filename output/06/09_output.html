      <div class="summary">
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">As described in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, killed Viśvarūpa, and therefore Viśvarūpa’s father performed a <span class="Italic">yajña</span> to kill Indra. When Vṛtrāsura appeared from that <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> the demigods, in fear, sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and glorified Him.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">Because of affection for the demons, Viśvarūpa secretly supplied them the remnants of <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> When Indra learned about this, he beheaded Viśvarūpa, but he later regretted killing Viśvarūpa because Viśvarūpa was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Although competent to neutralize the sinful reactions for killing a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> Indra did not do so. Instead he accepted the reactions. Later, he distributed these reactions among the land, water, trees and women in general. Since the land accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, a portion of the land turned into desert. The trees were also given one fourth of the sinful reactions, and therefore they drip sap, which is prohibited for drinking. Because women accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, they are untouchable during their menstrual period. Since water was also infested with sinful reactions, when bubbles appear in water it cannot be used for any purpose.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">After Viśvarūpa was killed, his father, Tvaṣṭā, performed a sacrifice to kill King Indra. Unfortunately, if <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are chanted irregularly, they yield an opposite result. This happened when Tvaṣṭā performed this <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> While performing the sacrifice to kill Indra. Tvaṣṭā chanted a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> to increase Indra’s enemies, but because he chanted the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> wrong, the sacrifice produced an <span class="Italic">asura</span> named Vṛtrāsura, of whom Indra was the enemy. When Vṛtrāsura was generated from the sacrifice, his fierce features made the whole world afraid, and his personal effulgence diminished even the power of the demigods. Finding no other means of protection, the demigods began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of all the results of sacrifice, who is supreme throughout the entire universe. The demigods all worshiped Him because ultimately no one but Him can protect a living entity from fear and danger. Seeking shelter of a demigod instead of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead is compared to trying to cross the ocean by grasping the tail of a dog. A dog can swim, but that does not mean that one can cross the ocean by grasping a dog’s tail.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">Being pleased with the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead advised them to approach Dadhīci to beg him for the bones of his own body. Dadhīci would comply with the request of the demigods, and with the help of his bones Vṛtrāsura could be killed.</div>

            Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Viśvarūpa, who was engaged as the priest of the demigods, had three heads. He used one to drink the beverage soma-rasa, another to drink wine and the third to eat food. O King Parīkṣit, thus I have heard from authorities.

            One cannot directly perceive the kingdom of heaven, its king and other inhabitants, or how they perform their various engagements, for no one can go to the heavenly planets. Although modern scientists have invented many powerful space vehicles, they cannot even go to the moon, not to speak of other planets. By direct experience one cannot learn anything beyond the range of human perception. One must hear from authorities. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī, a great personality, says, “What I am describing to you, O King, is what I have heard from authoritative sources.” This is the Vedic system. The Vedic knowledge is called <span class="Italic">śruti</span> because it must be received by being heard from authorities. It is beyond the realm of our false experimental knowledge.

            O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the demigods were related to Viśvarūpa from his father’s side, and therefore he visibly offered clarified butter in the fire while chanting mantras such as indrāya idaṁ svāhā [“this is meant for King Indra”] and idam agnaye [“this is for the demigod of fire”]. He loudly chanted these mantras and offered each of the demigods his proper share.

            Once upon a time, however, the King of heaven, Indra, understood that Viśvarūpa was secretly cheating the demigods by offering oblations on behalf of the demons. He became extremely afraid of being defeated by the demons, and in great anger at Viśvarūpa he cut Viśvarūpa’s three heads from his shoulders.

Tvaṣṭā intended to chant the word <span class="Italic">indra-śatro,</span> meaning, “O enemy of Indra.” In this <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> the word <span class="Italic">indra</span> is in the possessive case (<span class="Italic">ṣaṣṭhī</span>), and the word <span class="Italic">indra-śatro</span> is called a <span class="Italic">tat-puruṣa</span> compound (<span class="Italic">tatpuruṣa-samāsa</span>). Unfortunately, instead of chanting the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> short, Tvaṣṭā chanted it long, and its meaning changed from “the enemy of Indra” to “Indra, who is an enemy.” Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra’s, there emerged the body of Vṛtrāsura, of whom Indra was the enemy.

            Like arrows released in the four directions, the demon’s body grew, day after day. Tall and blackish, he appeared like a burnt hill and was as lustrous as a bright array of clouds in the evening. The hair on the demon’s body and his beard and moustache were the color of melted copper, and his eyes were piercing like the midday sun. He appeared unconquerable, as if holding the three worlds on the points of his blazing trident. Dancing and shouting with a loud voice, he made the entire surface of the earth tremble as if from an earthquake. As he yawned again and again, he seemed to be trying to swallow the whole sky with his mouth, which was as deep as a cave. He seemed to be licking up all the stars in the sky with his tongue and eating the entire universe with his long, sharp teeth. Seeing this gigantic demon, everyone, in great fear, ran here and there in all directions.

Even though the Lord appears before us as Lord Kṛṣṇa or Lord Rāmacandra and lives in human society as a leader or king, the conditioned soul cannot understand Him. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam: [Bg. </span>9.11] rascals (<span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span>) deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking Him an ordinary human being.

He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Rāma.

            In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is ascertained to be the original cause of creation. Śrīdhara Svāmī, in his commentary <span class="Italic">Bhāvārtha-dīpikā,</span> replies to the idea that <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated herein, <span class="Italic">paraṁ pradhānaṁ puruṣaṁ viśvam anyam:</span> “He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [<span class="Italic">virāṭ ’rūpa</span>].” The word <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> refers to the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (<span class="Italic">prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām</span>).

          <p>
            Although <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> superficially appear to be the causes of the material manifestation, both are emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the cause of <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">puruṣa.</span> He is the original cause (<span class="Italic">sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]). The <span class="Italic">Nāradīya Purāṇa</span> says:

            Both the <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> and <span class="Italic">puruṣa,</span> which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (<span class="Italic">gām āviśya</span>), the Lord enters the <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> and then the <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> creates different manifestations.

          </p>

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            The Supreme Personality of Godhead has numerous transcendental names pertaining to different grades of revelation to various grades of devotees and transcendentalists. When He is realized in His impersonal form He is called the Supreme Brahman, when realized as the Paramātmā He is called <span class="Italic">antaryāmī,</span> and when He expands Himself in different forms for material creation He is called Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. When He is realized as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha—the Caturvyūha, who are beyond the three forms of Viṣṇu—He is the Vaikuṇṭha Nārāyaṇa. Above realization of Nārāyaṇa is realization of Baladeva, and above that is realization of Kṛṣṇa. All these realizations are possible when one engages fully in devotional service. The covered core of one’s heart is then completely open to receiving an understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms.

            O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no material body, You do not need cooperation from us. Since You are the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material ingredients without being transformed, You create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself. Nevertheless, although You appear engaged in material activity, You are transcendental to all material qualities. Consequently these transcendental activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.

            The <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.37) says, <span class="Italic">goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ:</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is always situated in Goloka Vṛndāvana. It is also said, <span class="Italic">vṛndāvanaṁ parityajya padam ekaṁ na gacchati:</span> Kṛṣṇa never goes even a step from Vṛndāvana. Nevertheless, although Kṛṣṇa is situated in His own abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, He is simultaneously all-pervading and is therefore present everywhere. This is very difficult for a conditioned soul to understand. but devotees can understand how Kṛṣṇa, without undergoing any changes, can simultaneously be in His abode and be all-pervasive. The demigods are understood to be various limbs of the Supreme Lord’s body, although the Supreme Lord has no material body and does not need anyone’s help. He is spread everywhere (<span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā</span>). Nevertheless, He is not present everywhere in His spiritual form. According to the Māyāvāda philosophy, the Supreme Truth, being all-pervasive, does not need a transcendental form. The Māyāvādīs suppose that since His form is distributed everywhere, He has no form. This is untrue. The Lord keeps His transcendental form, and at the same time He extends everywhere, in every nook and corner of the material creation.

            These are our inquiries. The ordinary conditioned soul is subject to the material laws, and he thus receives the fruits of his actions. Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the contrary, are You present here only as a neutral witness who is self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of spiritual potency?

            In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa says that He descends to this material world for two purposes, namely <span class="Italic">paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]—to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees. These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth. When the Lord comes to punish the demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them relief, He also bestows His favor. Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the conditioned souls. When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts impiously, but the Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual potency, by which He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the protectable. The Lord is <span class="Italic">apāpa-viddham;</span> He is never contaminated by the reactions of so-called sinful activities. When Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth, He killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received <span class="Italic">sārūpya;</span> in other words, they returned to their original spiritual bodies. One who does not know the Lord’s position says that God is unkind to him but merciful to others. Actually the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.29), <span class="Italic">samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ:</span> “I am equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My friend.” But He also says, <span class="Italic">ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā mayi te teṣu cāpy aham:</span> “If one becomes My devotee and fully surrenders unto Me, I give him special attention.”

            O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls. Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong without knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false and their judgments inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the truth concerning You. Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions. You are one without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress, are not contradictory. Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position, You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.

            The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being self-sufficient, is full of transcendental bliss (<span class="Italic">ātmārāma</span>). He enjoys bliss in two ways—when He appears happy and when He appears distressed. Distinctions and contradictions are impossible in Him because only from Him have they emanated. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all knowledge, all potency, all strength, opulence and influence. There is no limit to His powers. Since He is full in all transcendental attributes, nothing abominable from the material world can exist in Him. He is transcendental and spiritual, and therefore conceptions of material happiness and distress do not apply to Him.
          </p>
          <p>
            We should not be astonished to find contradictions in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually there are no contradictions. That is the meaning of His being supreme. Because He is all-powerful, He is not subject to the conditioned soul’s arguments regarding His existence or nonexistence. He is pleased to protect His devotees by killing their enemies. He enjoys both the killing and the protecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such freedom from duality applies not only to the Lord but also to His devotees. In Vṛndāvana, the damsels of Vrajabhūmi enjoy transcendental bliss in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and they feel the same transcendental bliss in separation when Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma leave Vṛndāvana for Mathurā. There is no question of material pains or pleasures for either the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure devotees, although they are sometimes superficially said to be distressed or happy. One who is <span class="Italic">ātmārāma</span> is blissful in both ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nondevotees cannot understand the contradictions present in the Supreme Lord or His devotees. Therefore in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the Lord says, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti: [Bg. </span>18.55] the transcendental pastimes can be understood through devotional service; to nondevotees they are inconceivable. <span class="Italic">Acintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet:</span> the Supreme Lord and His form, name, pastimes and paraphernalia are inconceivable to nondevotees, and one should not try to understand such realities simply by logical arguments. They will not bring one to the right conclusion about the Absolute Truth.

The example cited herein is very appropriate. A rope is one truth, but some mistake it for a snake, whereas others know it to be a rope. Similarly, devotees who know the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not see contradictions in Him, but nondevotees regard Him as the snakelike source of all fear. For example, when Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared, Prahlāda Mahārāja saw the Lord as the supreme solace, whereas his father, a demon, saw Him as the ultimate death. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (11.2.37), <span class="Italic">bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syāt:</span> fear results from being absorbed in duality. When one is in knowledge of duality, one knows both fear and bliss. The same Supreme Lord is a source of bliss to devotees and fear to nondevotees who have a poor fund of knowledge. God is one, but people understand the Absolute Truth from different angles of vision. The unintelligent see contradictions in Him, but sober devotees find no contradictions.

Because of their pious activities, the <span class="Italic">sakāma</span> devotees are promoted to the higher planetary systems, but at heart they still desire to lord it over the material resources. The <span class="Italic">sakāma</span> devotees are sometimes disturbed by the demons and Rākṣasas, but the Lord is so kind that He always saves them by appearing as an incarnation.

He never disturbs the Lord. <span class="Italic">Sakāma</span> devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as they are in difficulty, but they are regarded as pious because they consider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the Lord. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (10.14.8):
          </p>

A neophyte devotee, of course, approaches the Supreme Lord for relief from distress or poverty, or for speculative knowledge of the Lord. <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.16) mentions four kinds of pious men who begin devotional service to the Lord—one who is distressed (<span class="Italic">ārta</span>), one in need of money (<span class="Italic">arthārthī</span>), one who is inquisitive (<span class="Italic">jijñāsu</span>) and one who is searching for the Absolute Truth (<span class="Italic">jñānī</span>). A pure devotee, however, knows that since the Lord is omnipresent and omniscient, there is no need to offer prayers or worship Him for one’s personal benefit. A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord without demanding anything. The Lord is present everywhere and knows the necessities of His devotees; consequently there is no need to disturb Him by asking Him for material benefits.

            The four classes of neophyte devotees who approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead to offer devotional service because of material motives are not pure devotees, but the advantage for such materialistic devotees is that they sometimes give up their material desires and become pure. When the demigods are utterly helpless, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead in grief and with tears in their eyes, praying to the Lord, and thus they become almost pure devotees, free from material desires. Admitting that they have forgotten pure devotional service because of extensive material opportunities, they fully surrender to the Lord, leaving to His consideration whether to maintain them or annihilate them. Such surrender is necessary. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings, <span class="Italic">mārabi rākhabi—yo icchā tohārā:</span> “O Lord, I fully surrender unto Your lotus feet. Now, as You desire, You may protect me or annihilate me. You have the full right to do either.”

            The demigods certainly wanted Lord Viṣṇu to relieve their anxiety, but now they directly approach Lord Kṛṣṇa, for although there is no difference between Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa descends to this planet in His Vāsudeva feature for the purpose of <span class="Italic">paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]—protecting His devotees and annihilating the miscreants. Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods, or devotees, and therefore Kṛṣṇa descends to punish the atheists and demons and fulfill the desire of His devotees. Kṛṣṇa, being the original cause of everything, is the Supreme Person, above even Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa, although there is no difference between these different forms of the Lord. As explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.46):

            The word <span class="Italic">mṛṣṭa-yaśase</span> is significant herein because Kṛṣṇa is always famous for relieving His devotee from danger.

            Another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Uttamaśloka, which means that He is offered prayers with selected verses. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">,</span> chanting and hearing about Lord Viṣṇu. Impersonalists cannot be purified, for they do not offer personal prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though they sometimes offer prayers, the prayers are not directed toward the Supreme Person. Impersonalists sometimes show their incomplete knowledge by addressing the Lord as being nameless. They always offer prayers indirectly, saying, “You are this, You are that,” but they do not know to whom they are praying. A devotee, however, always offers personal prayers. A devotee says, <span class="Italic">govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **:</span> “I offer my respectful obeisances unto Govinda, unto Kṛṣṇa.” That is the way to offer prayers. If one continues to offer such personal prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is eligible to become a pure devotee and return home, back to Godhead.

Although without difficulty one can get anything he desires if the Lord is pleased, the demigods aspire for material profit by pleasing the Lord. The Lord wanted the demigods to pray for unalloyed devotional service, but instead they prayed for an opportunity to kill their enemy. This is the difference between a pure devotee and a devotee on the material platform. Indirectly, the Lord regretted that the demigods did not ask for pure devotional service.

            There are two classes of men—namely the <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa</span> and the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is one who knows Brahman, the Absolute Truth, and who thus knows his real interest. A <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa,</span> however, is one who has a material, bodily concept of life. Not knowing how to utilize his human or demigod life, a <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa</span> is attracted by things created by the material modes of nature. The <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇas,</span> who always desire material benefits, are foolish, whereas <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> who always desire spiritual benefits, are intelligent. If a <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa,</span> not knowing his self-interest, foolishly asks for something material, one who awards it to him is also foolish. Kṛṣṇa, however, is not a foolish person; He is supremely intelligent. If someone comes to Kṛṣṇa asking for material benefits, Kṛṣṇa does not award him the material things he desires. Instead, the Lord gives him intelligence so that he will forget his material desires and become attached to the Lord’s lotus feet. In such cases, although the <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa</span> offers prayers to Lord Kṛṣṇa for material things, the Lord takes away whatever material possessions the <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa</span> has and gives him the sense to become a devotee. As stated by the Lord in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> 22.39):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.” If one sincerely prays to God for material possessions in exchange for devotional service, the Lord, who is not foolish like such an unintelligent devotee, shows him special favor by taking away whatever material possessions he has and gradually giving him the intelligence to be satisfied only by rendering service to His lotus feet. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments in this regard that if a foolish child requests his mother to give him poison, the mother, being intelligent, will certainly not give him poison, even though he requests it. A materialist does not know that to accept material possessions means to accept poison, or the repetition of birth and death. An intelligent person, a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> aspires for liberation from material bondage. That is the real self-interest of a human being.

          <p>
            Conditioned souls are generally bereft of intelligence because of profound desires for sense gratification. They do not know what benedictions to ask. Therefore nondevotees are advised in the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> to worship various demigods to achieve material benefits. For example, if one wants a beautiful wife, he is advised to worship Umā, or goddess Durgā. If one wants to be cured of a disease, he is advised to worship the sun-god. All requests for benedictions from the demigods, however, are due to material lust. The benedictions will be finished at the end of the cosmic manifestation, along with those who bestow them. If one approaches Lord Viṣṇu for benedictions, the Lord will give him a benediction that will help him return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.10):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            Lord Viṣṇu, or Lord Kṛṣṇa, instructs a devotee who constantly engages in His service how to approach Him at the end of his material body. The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.9):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities, does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” This is the benediction of Lord Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa. After giving up his body, a devotee returns home, back to Godhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            A devotee may foolishly ask for material benedictions, but Lord Kṛṣṇa does not give him such benedictions, despite the devotee’s prayers. Therefore people who are very attached to material life do not generally become devotees of Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu. Instead they become devotees of the demigods (<span class="Italic">kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ [Bg. </span>7.20]). The benedictions of the demigods, however, are condemned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> <span class="Italic">Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām:</span> “Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.” A non-Vaiṣṇava, one who is not engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered a fool with a small quantity of brain substance.

Since Maghavan, the King of heaven, still aspired for a comfortable bodily situation, Lord Viṣṇu advised him to ask Dadhyañca for his body, which was very strong due to his knowledge, vows and austerity.

            That saintly Dadhyañca, who is also known as Dadhīci, personally assimilated the spiritual science and then delivered it to the Aśvinī-kumāras. It is said that Dadhyañca gave them mantras through the head of a horse. Therefore the mantras are called Aśvaśira. After obtaining the mantras of spiritual science from Dadhīci, the Aśvinī-kumāras became jīvan-mukta, liberated even in this life.

            The great saint Dadhīci had perfect knowledge of how to perform fruitive activities, and he had advanced spiritual knowledge as well. Knowing this, the Aśvinī-kumāras once approached him and begged him to instruct them in spiritual science (<span class="Italic">brahma-vidyā</span>). Dadhīci Muni replied, “I am now engaged in arranging sacrifices for fruitive activities. Come back some time later.” When the Aśvinī-kumāras left, Indra, the King of heaven, approached Dadhīci and said, “My dear Muni, the Aśvinī-kumāras are only physicians. Please do not instruct them in spiritual science. If you impart the spiritual science to them despite my warning, I shall punish you by cutting off your head.” After warning Dadhīci in this way, Indra returned to heaven. The Aśvinī-kumāras, who understood Indra’s desires, returned and begged Dadhīci for <span class="Italic">brahma-vidyā.</span> When the great saint Dadhīci informed them of Indra’s threat, the Aśvinī-kumāras replied, “Let us first cut off your head and replace it with the head of a horse. You can instruct <span class="Italic">brahma-vidyā</span> through the horse’s head, and when Indra returns and cuts off that head, we shall reward you and restore your original head.” Since Dadhīci had promised to impart <span class="Italic">brahma-vidyā</span> to the Aśvinī-kumāras, he agreed to their proposal. Therefore, because Dadhīci imparted <span class="Italic">brahma-vidyā</span> through the mouth of a horse, this <span class="Italic">brahma-vidyā</span> is also known as Aśvaśira.

            Dadhyañca’s invincible protective covering known as the Nārāyaṇa-kavaca was given to Tvaṣṭā, who delivered it to his son Viśvarūpa, from whom you have received it. Because of this Nārāyaṇa-kavaca, Dadhīci’s body is now very strong. You should therefore beg him for his body.

            When the Aśvinī-kumāras beg for Dadhyañca’s body on your behalf, he will surely give it because of affection. Do not doubt this, for Dadhyañca is very experienced in religious understanding. When Dadhyañca awards you his body, Viśvakarmā will prepare a thunderbolt from his bones. This thunderbolt will certainly kill Vṛtrāsura because it will be invested with My power.

            When Vṛtrāsura is killed because of My spiritual strength, you will regain your strength, weapons and wealth. Thus there will be all good fortune for all of you. Although Vṛtrāsura can destroy all the three worlds, do not fear that he will harm you. He is also a devotee and will never be envious of you.

            A devotee of the Lord is never envious of anyone, what to speak of other devotees. As revealed later, Vṛtrāsura was also a devotee. Therefore be was not expected to be envious of the demigods. Indeed, of his own accord, he would try to benefit the demigods. A devotee does not hesitate to give up his own body for a better cause. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said, <span class="Italic">san-nimitte varaṁ tyāgo vināśe niyate sati.</span> After all, all one’s material possessions, including his body, will be destroyed in due course of time. Therefore if the body and other possessions can be utilized for a better cause, a devotee never hesitates to give up even his own body. Because Lord Viṣṇu wanted to save the demigods, Vṛtrāsura, even though able to swallow the three worlds, would agree to be killed by the demigods. For a devotee there is no difference between living and dying because in this life a devotee engages in devotional service, and after giving up his body, he engages in the same service in the spiritual world. His devotional service is never hindered.
