          <div class="Normal-Level">As related in this chapter, Citraketu was able to talk with his dead son and hear from him the truth of life. When Citraketu was appeased, the great sage Nārada gave him a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and by chanting this <span class="Italic">mantra</span> Citraketu found shelter at the lotus feet of Saṅkarṣaṇa.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">The living entity is eternal. Thus he has neither birth nor death (<span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]). According to the reactions of one’s fruitive activities, one takes birth in various species of life among the birds, beasts, trees, human beings, demigods and so on, thus rotating through various bodies. For a certain period of time, one receives a particular type of body as a son or father in a false relationship. All our relationships in this material world with friends, relatives or enemies consist of duality, in which one feels happy and distressed on the basis of illusion. The living entity is actually a spiritual soul who is part and parcel of God and has nothing to do with relationships in the world of duality. Therefore Nārada Muni advised Citraketu not to lament for his so-called dead son.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">After hearing instructions from their dead child, Citraketu and his wife could understand that all relationships in this material world are causes of misery. The queens who had administered poison to the son of Kṛtadyuti were very much ashamed. They atoned for the sinful act of killing a child and gave up their aspiration to have sons. Thereafter. Nārada Muni chanted prayers to Nārāyaṇa, who exists as <span class="Italic">catur-vyūha,</span> and instructed Citraketu about the Supreme Lord, who creates, maintains and annihilates everything and who is the master of the material nature. After instructing King Citraketu in this way, he returned to Brahmaloka. These instructions about the Absolute Truth are called the <span class="Italic">mahā-vidyā.</span> After being initiated by Nārada Muni, King Citraketu chanted the <span class="Italic">mahā-vidyā,</span> and after one week he attained the presence of Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa, who was surrounded by the four Kumāras. The Lord was nicely dressed in bluish garments, with a helmet and ornaments of gold. His face appeared very happy. In the presence of Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa, Citraketu offered his obeisances and began to offer prayers.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">In his prayers, Citraketu said that millions of universes rest in the pores of Saṅkarṣaṇa, who is limitless, having no beginning and end. The Lord is well known to the devotees for His eternity. The difference between worshiping the Lord and worshiping the demigods is that the worshiper of the Lord also becomes eternal, whereas whatever benedictions one can get from the demigods are impermanent. Unless one becomes a devotee, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">After Citraketu finished his prayers, the unlimited Supreme Lord explained knowledge of Himself to Citraketu.</div>

            By the mystic power of Nārada Muni, the living entity reentered his dead body for a short time and spoke in reply to Nārada Muni’s request. He said: According to the results of my fruitive activities, I, the living being, transmigrate from one body to another, sometimes going to the species of the demigods, sometimes to the species of lower animals, sometimes among the vegetables, and sometimes to the human species. Therefore, in which birth were these my mother and father? No one is actually my mother and father. How can I accept these two people as my parents?

        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_4_purport">
          <p>
            Here it is made clear that the living being enters a material body that is like a machine created by the five gross elements of material nature (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the three subtle elements (mind, intelligence and ego). As confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> there are two separate identities, called the inferior and superior natures, which both belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to the results of a living entity’s fruitive actions, he is forced to enter the material elements in different types of bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time the living entity was supposed to have been the son of Mahārāja Citraketu and Queen Kṛtadyuti because according to the laws of nature he had entered a body made by the King and Queen. Actually, however, he was not their son. The living entity is the son of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because he wants to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Lord gives him a chance to enter various bodies. The living entity has no true relationship with the material body he gets from his material father and mother. He is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but he is allowed to go through different bodies. The body created by the so-called father and mother actually has nothing to do with its so-called creators. Therefore the living entity flatly denied that Mahārāja Citraketu and his wife were his father and mother.

            In this material world, which advances like a river that carries away the living entity, all people become friends, relatives and enemies in due course of time. They also act neutrally, they mediate, they despise one another, and they act in many other relationships. Nonetheless, despite these various transactions, no one is permanently related.

        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_5_purport">

            It is our practical experience in this material world that the same person who is one’s friend today becomes one’s enemy tomorrow. Our relationships as friends or enemies, family men or outsiders, are actually the results of our different dealings. Citraketu Mahārāja was lamenting for his son, who was now dead, but he could have considered the situation otherwise. “This living entity,” he could have thought, “was my enemy in my last life, and now, having appeared as my son, he is prematurely leaving just to give me pain and agony.” Why should he not consider his dead son his former enemy and instead of lamenting be jubilant because of an enemy’s death? As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (3.27), <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ:</span> factually everything is happening because of our association with the modes of material nature. Therefore one who is my friend today in association with the mode of goodness may be my enemy tomorrow in association with the modes of passion and ignorance. As the modes of material nature work, in illusion we accept others as friends, enemies, sons or fathers in terms of the reactions of different dealings under different conditions.

            Just as gold and other commodities are continually transferred from one place to another in due course of purchase and sale, so the living entity, as a result of his fruitive activities, wanders throughout the entire universe, being injected into various bodies in different species of life by one kind of father after another.

        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_6_purport">

            It has already been explained that Citraketu’s son was his enemy in a past life and had now appeared as his son just to give him more severe pain. Indeed, the untimely death of the son caused severe lamentation for the father. One may put forward the argument, “If the King’s son was his enemy, how could the King have so much affection for him?” In answer, the example is given that when someone’s wealth falls into the bands of his enemy, the money becomes the enemy’s friend. Then the enemy can use it for his own purposes. Indeed, he can even use it to harm its previous owner. Therefore the money belongs neither to the one party nor to the other. The money is always money, but in different situations it can be used as an enemy or a friend.
          </p>
          <p>
            As explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is not by any father or mother that the living entity is given his birth. The living entity is a completely separate identity from the so-called father and mother. By the laws of nature, the living entity is forced to enter the semen of a father and be injected into the womb of the mother. He is not in control of selecting what kind of father he will accept. <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni:</span> the laws of nature force him to go to different fathers and mothers, just like a consumer commodity that is purchased and sold. Therefore the so-called relationship of father and son is an arrangement of <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> or nature. It has no meaning, and therefore it is called illusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same living entity sometimes takes shelter of an animal father and mother and sometimes a human father and mother. Sometimes he accepts a father and mother among the birds, and sometimes he accepts a demigod father and mother. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva<br>guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Harassed life after life by the laws of nature, the living entity wanders throughout the entire universe in different planets and different species of life. Somehow or other, if he is fortunate enough, he comes in touch with a devotee who reforms his entire life. Then the living entity goes back home, back to Godhead. Therefore it is said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya<br>kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile baja hari ei</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the transmigration of the soul through different bodies, everyone, in every form of life—be it human, animal, tree or demigod—gets a father and mother. This is not very difficult. The difficulty is to obtain a bona fide spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Therefore the duty of a human being is to capture the opportunity to come in touch with Kṛṣṇa’s representative, the bona fide spiritual master. Under the guidance of the spiritual master, the spiritual father, one can return home, back to Godhead.

            A few living entities are born in the human species, and others are born as animals. Although both are living entities, their relationships are impermanent. An animal may remain in the custody of a human being for some time, and then the same animal may be transferred to the possession of other human beings. As soon as the animal goes away, the former proprietor no longer has a sense of ownership. As long as the animal is in his possession he certainly has an affinity for it, but as soon as the animal is sold, the affinity is lost.

            Aside from the fact that the soul transmigrates from one body to another, even in this life the relationships between living entities are impermanent, as exemplified in this verse. The son of Citraketu was named Harṣaśoka, or “jubilation and lamentation.” The living entity is certainly eternal, but because he is covered by a temporary dress, the body, his eternity is not observed. <span class="Italic">Dehino ’smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā: [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span> “The embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age.” Thus the bodily dress is impermanent. The living entity, however, is permanent. As an animal is transferred from one owner to another, the living entity who was the son of Citraketu lived as his son for some time, but as soon as he was transferred to another body, the affectionate relationship was broken. As stated in the example given in the previous verse, when one has a commodity in his hands he considers it his, but as soon as it is transferred it becomes someone else’s commodity. Then one no longer has a relationship with it; he has no affection for it, nor does he lament for it.

            Even though one living entity becomes connected with another because of a relationship based on bodies that are perishable, the living entity is eternal. Actually it is the body that is born or lost, not the living entity. One should not accept that the living entity takes birth or dies. The living being actually has no relationship with so-called fathers and mothers. As long as he appears as the son of a certain father and mother as a result of his past fruitive activities, he has a connection with the body given by that father and mother. Thus he falsely accepts himself as their son and acts affectionately. After he dies, however, the relationship is finished. Under these circumstances, one should not be falsely involved with jubilation and lamentation.

            When the living entity lives within the material body, he falsely thinks that he is the body, although actually he is not. His relationship with his body and his so-called father and mother are false, illusory conceptions. These illusions continue as long as one is not enlightened about the situation of the living entity.

            The living entity is eternal and imperishable because he actually has no beginning and no end. He never takes birth or dies. He is the basic principle of all types of bodies, yet he does not belong to the bodily category. The living being is so sublime that he is equal in quality to the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, because he is extremely small, he is prone to be illusioned by the external energy, and thus he creates various bodies for himself according to his different desires.

            In this verse the philosophy of <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda</span>—simultaneous oneness and difference—is described. The living entity is eternal (<span class="Italic">nitya</span>) like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the difference is that the Supreme Lord is the greatest, no one being equal to or greater than Him, whereas the living entity is <span class="Italic">sūkṣma,</span> or extremely small. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> describes that the magnitude of the living entity is one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading (<span class="Italic">aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham</span>). Relatively, if the living entity is accepted as the smallest, there should naturally be inquiry about the greatest. The greatest is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the smallest is the living entity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another peculiar characteristic of the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is that he becomes covered by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmamāyā-guṇaiḥ:</span> he is prone to being covered by the Supreme Lord’s illusory energy. The living entity is responsible for his conditional life in the material world, and therefore he is described as <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> (“the master”). If he likes he can come to this material world, and if he likes he can return home, back to Godhead. Because he wanted to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gave him a material body through the agency of the material energy. As the Lord Himself says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (18.61):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br>hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati<br>bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni<br>yantrārūḍhāni māyayā</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.” The Supreme Lord gives the living entity a chance to enjoy in this material world as he desires, but He openly expresses His own desire that the living entity give up all material aspirations, fully surrender unto Him and return home, back to Godhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The living entity is the smallest (<span class="Italic">sūkṣma</span>). Jīva Gosvāmī says in this connection that the living entity within the body is extremely difficult for materialistic scientists to find, although we understand from authorities that the living entity is within the body. The body is different from the living entity.

            For this living entity, no one is dear, nor is anyone unfavorable. He makes no distinction between that which is his own and that which belongs to anyone else. He is one without a second; in other words, he is not affected by friends and enemies, well-wishers or mischief-mongers. He is only an observer, a witness, of the different qualities of men.

            As explained in the previous verse, the living entity has the same qualities as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he has them in minute quantities because he is a small particle (<span class="Italic">sūkṣma</span>) whereas the Supreme Lord is all-pervading and great. For the Supreme Lord there are no friends, enemies or relatives, for He is completely free from all the disqualifications of ignorance that characterize the conditioned souls. On the other hand, He is extremely kind and favorable to His devotees, and He is not at all satisfied with persons who are envious of His devotees. As the Lord Himself confirms in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.29):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu<br>na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ<br>ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā<br>mayi te teṣu cāpy aham</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.” The Supreme Lord has no enemy or friend, but He is inclined toward a devotee who always engages in His devotional service. Similarly, elsewhere in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Gītā</span> (16.19) the Lord says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān<br>saṁsāreṣu narādhamān<br>kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān<br>āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.” The Lord is extremely antagonistic toward those who are envious of His devotees. To protect His devotees, the Lord sometimes has to kill their enemies. For example, to protect Prahlāda Mahārāja, the Lord had to kill his enemy Hiraṇyakaśipu, although Hiraṇyakaśipu attained salvation because of being killed by the Lord. Since the Lord is the witness of everyone’s activities, He witnesses the actions of the enemies of His devotees, and He is inclined to punish them. In other cases, however, He simply witnesses what the living entities do and gives the results of one’s sinful or pious actions.

            The Supreme Lord [ātmā], the creator of cause and effect, does not accept the happiness and distress that result from fruitive actions. He is completely independent of having to accept a material body, and because He has no material body, He is always neutral. The living entities, being part and parcel of the Lord, possess His qualities in a minute quantity. Therefore one should not be affected by lamentation.

            The conditioned soul has friends and enemies. He is affected by the good qualities and the faults of his position. The Supreme Lord, however, is always transcendental. Because He is the <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> the supreme controller, He is not affected by duality. It may therefore be said that He sits in the core of everyone’s heart as the neutral witness of the causes and effects of one’s activities, good and bad. We should also understand that <span class="Italic">udāsīna,</span> neutral, does not mean that He takes no action. Rather, it means that He is not personally affected. For example, a court judge is neutral when two opposing parties appear before him, but he still takes action as the case warrants. To become completely neutral, indifferent, to material activities, we should simply seek shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme neutral person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mahārāja Citraketu was advised that remaining neutral in such trying circumstances as the death of one’s son is impossible. Nevertheless, since the Lord knows how to adjust everything, the best course is to depend upon Him and do one’s duty in devotional service to the Lord. In all circumstances, one should be undisturbed by duality. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (2.47):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          <p>
            “You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.” One should execute one’s devotional duty, and for the results of one’s actions one should depend upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Thus they cut off the shackles of their affection, which was due to their relationship with him, and gave up their lamentation.

            In this verse the word <span class="Italic">bāla-hatyā-hata-prabhāḥ</span> is to be particularly noted. The practice of killing children has existed in human society for a long time—since time immemorial—but in the days of yore it was very rarely performed. At the present moment, however, in this age of Kali, abortion—killing of the child within the womb—has become very common, and sometimes a child is even killed after birth. If a woman performs such an abominable act, she gradually loses all her bodily luster (<span class="Italic">bāla-hatyā-hata-prabhāḥ</span>). It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison to the child were very much ashamed, and according to the directions of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they had to undergo atonement for killing the child. Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful act must atone for it, but no one now is doing that. Under the circumstances, the women responsible must suffer in this life and the next. Those who are sincere souls, after hearing this incident, should refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously. If one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> without offenses, all of one’s sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately, but one should not commit such deeds again, for that is an offense.

From Saṅkarṣaṇa comes a second Nārāyaṇa expansion, and from this Nārāyaṇa come further expansions of Vāsudeva, Pradyumna, Saṅkarṣaṇa and Aniruddha. The Saṅkarṣaṇa in this group is the original cause of the three <span class="Italic">puruṣas,</span> namely Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu.

            “O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.” In the conditioned state of life, the body is used as our dress, and as one needs different dresses during the summer and winter, we conditioned souls are changing bodies according to our desires. However, because the body of the Supreme Lord is full of knowledge, it needs no covering. The idea that Kṛṣṇa’s body is like ours—in other words, that His body and soul are different—is a misunderstanding. There are no such differences for Kṛṣṇa, because His body is full of knowledge. Here we receive material bodies because of a lack of knowledge, but because Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, is full of knowledge, there is no difference between His body and His soul. Kṛṣṇa remembers what He said forty million years ago to the sun-god, but an ordinary being cannot remember what he said the day before yesterday. This is the difference between Kṛṣṇa’s body and our body. Therefore the Lord is addressed as <span class="Italic">vijñāna-mātrāya paramānanda-mūrtaye.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the Lord’s body is full of knowledge, He always enjoys transcendental bliss. Indeed, His very form is <span class="Italic">paramānanda.</span> This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra:</span> <span class="Italic">ānandamayo’bhyāsāt.</span> By nature the Lord is <span class="Italic">ānandamaya.</span> Whenever we see Kṛṣṇa, He is always full of <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> in all circumstances. No one can make Him morose. <span class="Italic">Ātmārāmāya:</span> He does not need to search for external enjoyment, because He is self-sufficient. <span class="Italic">Śāntāya:</span> He has no anxiety. One who has to seek pleasure from other sources is always full of anxiety. <span class="Italic">Karmīs, jñānīs</span> and <span class="Italic">yogīs</span> are full of anxiety because they want something, but a devotee does not want anything; he is simply satisfied in the service of the Lord, who is fully blissful.

          <p>
            <span class="Italic">Nivṛtta-dvaita-dṛṣṭaye:</span> in our conditioned life our bodies have different parts, but although Kṛṣṇa apparently has different bodily parts, no part of His body is different from any other part. Kṛṣṇa can see with His eyes, and Kṛṣṇa can see without His eyes. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">paśyaty acakṣuḥ.</span> He can see with His hands and legs. He does not need a particular bodily part to perform a particular action. <span class="Italic">Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti:</span> He can do anything He desires with any part of His body, and therefore He is called almighty.

The form of the Lord and the form of the conditioned soul are different because the Lord is always blissful whereas the conditioned soul is always under the threefold miseries of the material world. The Supreme Lord is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha</span><i> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> He derives <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> bliss, from His own self. The Lord’s body is transcendental, spiritual, but because the conditioned soul has a material body, he has many bodily and mental troubles. The conditioned soul is always perturbed by attachment and detachment, whereas the Supreme Lord is always free from such dualities. The Lord is the supreme master of all the senses, whereas the conditioned soul is controlled by the senses. The Lord is the greatest, whereas the living entity is the smallest. The living entity is conditioned by the waves of material nature, but the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all actions and reactions. The expansions of the Supreme Lord’s body are innumerable (<span class="Italic">advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam [Bs </span>5.33]), but the conditioned soul is limited to only one form. From history we learn that a conditioned soul, by mystic power, can sometimes expand into eight forms, but the Lord’s bodily expansions are unlimited. This means that the bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no beginning and no end, unlike the bodies of the living entities.

            As iron has the power to burn when made red-hot in the association of fire, so the body, senses, living force, mind and intelligence, although merely lumps of matter, can function in their activities when infused with a particle of consciousness by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As iron cannot burn unless heated by fire, the bodily senses cannot act unless favored by the Supreme Brahman.

            Red-hot iron can burn, but it cannot burn the original fire. Therefore the consciousness of the small particle of Brahman is fully dependent on the power of the Supreme Brahman. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the Lord says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:</span> [Bg. 15.15] “From Me the conditioned soul receives memory, knowledge and forgetfulness.” The power for activities comes from the Supreme Lord, and when the Lord withdraws this power, the conditioned soul no longer has energy with which to act through his various senses. The body includes five knowledge-acquiring senses, five active senses and the mind, but actually these are merely lumps of matter. For example, the brain is nothing but matter, but when electrified by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the brain can act, just as iron can burn when made red-hot by the influence of fire. The brain can act while we are awake or even while we are dreaming, but when we are fast asleep or unconscious the brain is inactive. Since the brain is a lump of matter, it does not have independent power with which to act. It can act only when favored by the influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is Brahman or Parabrahman. This is the way to understand how the Supreme Brahman, Kṛṣṇa, is present everywhere, just as the sunshine is present because of the sun-god in the sun globe. The Supreme Lord is called Hṛṣīkeśa; He is the only conductor of the senses. Unless empowered by His energy, our senses cannot act. In other words, He is the only seer, the only worker, the only listener, and the only active principle or supreme controller.

            It is said that the Absolute Truth is one, but is manifested in different features as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. The previous verses described the Brahman and Paramātmā features of the Absolute Truth. Now this prayer is offered in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> to the Absolute Supreme Person. The words used in this regard are <span class="Italic">sakala-sātvata-parivṛḍha.</span> The word <span class="Italic">sātvata</span> means “devotees,” and <span class="Italic">sakala</span> means “all together.” The devotees, who also have lotus feet, serve the lotus feet of the Lord with their lotus hands. The devotees may sometimes not be competent to serve the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore the Lord is addressed as <span class="Italic">parama-parameṣṭhin.</span> He is the Supreme Person, yet He is very kind to the devotees. No one is competent to serve the Lord, but even if a devotee is not competent, the merciful Lord accepts the humble attempt of the devotee.

            Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Nārada, having become the spiritual master of Citraketu, instructed him fully in this prayer because Citraketu was fully surrendered. O King Parīkṣit, Nārada then left with the great sage Aṅgirā for the topmost planet, known as Brahmaloka.

            When Aṅgirā had first come to visit King Citraketu, he did not bring Nārada with him. However, after the death of Citraketu’s son, Aṅgirā brought Nārada to instruct King Citraketu about <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> The difference was that in the beginning Citraketu was not in a temperament of renunciation, but after the death of his son, when he was overwhelmed by his great plight, he was awakened to the platform of renunciation by instructions regarding the falsity of this material world and material possessions. It is only at this stage that <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> can be instructed. As long as one is attached to material enjoyment, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> cannot be understood. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (2.44):

            “In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place.” As long as one is very much attached to material enjoyment, one cannot concentrate his mind on the subject matter of devotional service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is progressing successfully in the Western countries at the present moment because the youth in the West have reached the stage of <span class="Italic">vairāgya,</span> or renunciation. They are practically disgusted with material pleasure from material sources, and this has resulted in a population of hippies throughout the Western countries. Now if these young people are instructed about <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the instructions will certainly be effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Citraketu understood the philosophy of <span class="Italic">vairāgya-vidyā,</span> the knowledge of renunciation, he could understand the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> In this regard Śrīla Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya has said, <span class="Italic">vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga</span> [Cc. Madya 6.254]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Vairāgya-vidyā</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> are parallel lines. One is essential for understanding the other. It is also said, <span class="Italic">bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 11.2.42). Advancement in devotional service, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is characterized by increasing renunciation of material enjoyment. Nārada Muni is the father of devotional service, and therefore, just to bestow causeless mercy upon King Citraketu, Aṅgirā brought Nārada Muni to instruct the King. These instructions were extremely effective. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Nārada Muni is certainly a pure devotee.

A devotee need not practice <span class="Italic">yoga, karma</span> or <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> to achieve a successful result.

            A devotee’s ultimate achievement is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in any one of the planets in the spiritual sky. As a result of rigid execution of devotional service, a devotee receives all material opulences if these are required; otherwise, the devotee is not interested in material opulences, nor does the Supreme Lord award them. When a devotee is actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, his apparently material opulences are not material; they are all spiritual. For example, if a devotee spends money to construct a beautiful and costly temple, the construction is not material but spiritual (<span class="Italic">nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate</span>). A devotee’s mind is never diverted to the material side of the temple. The bricks, stone and wood used in the construction of the temple are spiritual, just as the Deity, although made of stone, is not stone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the more he can understand the elements of devotional service. Nothing in devotional service is material; everything is spiritual. Consequently a devotee is awarded so-called material opulence for spiritual advancement. This opulence is an aid to help the devotee advance toward the spiritual kingdom. Thus Mahārāja Citraketu remained in material opulence as a <span class="Italic">vidyādhara-pati,</span> master of the Vidyādharas, and by executing devotional service he became perfect within a very few days and returned home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Śeṣa, Ananta.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <span class="Italic">karmī’s</span> material opulence and a devotee’s material opulence are not on the same level. Śrīla Madhvācārya comments in this way:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            By worshiping Lord Viṣṇu one can get whatever he desires, but a pure devotee never asks Lord Viṣṇu for any material profit. Instead he serves Lord Viṣṇu without material desires and is therefore ultimately transferred to the spiritual kingdom. In this regard, Śrīla Vīrarāghava Ācārya comments, <span class="Italic">yatheṣṭa-gatir ity arthaḥ:</span> by worshiping Viṣṇu, a devotee can get whatever he likes.

            One cannot offer prayers to the Lord with mundane words. One must become spiritually advanced by controlling the mind and senses.

            Citraketu said: O unconquerable Lord, although You cannot be conquered by anyone, You are certainly conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses. They can keep You under their control because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You.

            The Lord and the devotees both conquer. The Lord is conquered by the devotees, and the devotees are conquered by the Lord. Because of being conquered by one another, they both derive transcendental bliss from their relationship. The highest perfection of this mutual conquering is exhibited by Kṛṣṇa and the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> The <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> conquered Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa conquered the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> Thus whenever Kṛṣṇa played His flute, He conquered the minds of the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> and without seeing the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> Kṛṣṇa could not be happy. Other transcendentalists, such as <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> and <span class="Italic">yogīs,</span> cannot conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead; only pure devotees can conquer Him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pure devotees are described as <span class="Italic">sama-mati,
            </span> which means that they never deviate from devotional service under any circumstances. It is not that devotees worship the Supreme Lord only when happy; they worship Him even when in distress. Happiness and distress do not hamper the process of devotional service. Therefore <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> says
            that devotional service is <span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihatā,</span> unmotivated and uninterrupted. When a devotee offers devotional service to the Lord without any motive (<span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><span class="Ref_It
            alic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu </span><popup><div class="Verse">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ<

          <p>
            “<b>One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.</b>” <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</span> 1.1.11<lt>1.1.11], his service cannot be hampered by any material condition (<span class="Italic">apratihatā</span>). Thus a devotee who offers service in all conditions of life can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</lt>
          </p>
          <p>
            A special distinction between devotees and the other transcendentalists, namely the <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> and <span class="Italic">yogīs,</span> is that <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> and <span class="Italic">yogīs</span> artificially try to become one with the Supreme, whereas devotees never aspire for such an impossible accomplishment. Devotees know that their position is to be eternally servants of the Supreme Lord and never to be one with Him. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">sama-mati</span> or <span class="Italic">jitātmā.</span> They detest oneness with the Supreme. They have no lusty desires for oneness; instead, their desire is to be freed from all material hankering. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">niṣkāma,</span> desireless. A living entity cannot exist without desires, but desires that can never be fulfilled are called <span class="Italic">kāma,</span> lusty desires. <span class="Italic">Kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ: [Bg. </span>7.20] because of lusty desires, nondevotees are deprived of their intelligence. Thus they are unable to conquer the Supreme Lord, whereas devotees, being freed from such unreasonable desires, can conquer the Lord. Such devotees are also conquered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are pure, being free from all material desires, they fully surrender to the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord conquers them. Such devotees never aspire for liberation. They simply desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. Because they serve the Lord without desires for remuneration, they can conquer the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is by nature very merciful, and when He sees that His servant is working without desires for material profit, naturally He is conquered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Devotees are always engaged in service.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            All the activities of their senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. Because of such devotion, the Lord gives Himself to His devotees as if they could use Him for any purpose they might desire. Of course, devotees have no purpose other than to serve. When a devotee fully surrenders and has no aspiration for material profit, the Lord certainly gives him all opportunities for service. This is the position of the Lord when conquered by His devotees.

            My dear Lord, this cosmic manifestation and its creation, maintenance and annihilation are all but Your opulences. Since Lord Brahmā and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of You, their partial power to create does not make them God [īśvara]. Their consciousness of themselves as separate Lords is therefore merely false prestige. It is not valid.

            A devotee who has fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord knows very well that the creative energy of the living entities, from Lord Brahmā down to the small ant, exists because the living entities are part and parcel of the Lord. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.7) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ:</span> “The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.” The living entities are nothing but very small portions of the supreme spirit, like sparks of a fire. Because they are part of the Supreme, they have a creative quality in a very minute quantity.

            The so-called scientists of the modern materialistic world are proud because they have created modern facilities like great airplanes, but the credit for creating the airplanes should go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to the scientists who have invented or created the so-called wonderful products. The first consideration is the intelligence of the scientist; one must be elevated by the dictation of the Supreme Lord, who says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.15), <span class="Italic">mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:</span> “From Me comes remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.” Because the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, sits within the core of every living entity’s heart, the dictation by which one advances in scientific knowledge or creative faculties comes from Him. Furthermore, the ingredients to manufacture wonderful machines like airplanes are also supplied by the Lord, not by the scientists. Before the airplane was created, its ingredients already existed, having been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when the manifested creation of the airplane is ruined, the remaining debris is a problem for the so-called creators. Another example is that the West is creating many automobiles. The ingredients for these cars are supplied, of course, by the Supreme Lord, and the intelligence for the so-called creation is also supplied by the Lord. Ultimately, when the cars are demolished, the so-called creators are faced with the problem of what to do with their ingredients. The actual creator, the original creator, is the Personality of Godhead. Only in the interim does someone create something with intelligence supplied by the Lord, and later the creation again becomes a problem. Therefore the so-called creator is not to be credited with the act of creation; the only credit goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is rightly stated herein that the credit for all the opulences of creation, maintenance and annihilation belongs to the Supreme Lord, not to the living entities.

            “I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person—absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no cause, for He is the cause of everything. The Lord is beyond the workings of cause and effect. He is eternally existing. In another verse the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> says, <span class="Italic">aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham:</span> the Lord exists within the gigantic universe and within the atom. The descent of the Lord into the atom and the universe indicates that without His presence, nothing could factually exist. Scientists say that water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but when they see a vast ocean they are puzzled about where such a quantity of hydrogen and oxygen could have come from. They think that everything evolved from chemicals, but where did the chemicals come from? That they do not know. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, He can produce immense quantities of chemicals to create a situation for chemical evolution. We actually see that chemicals are produced from living entities. For example, a lemon tree produces many tons of citric acid. The citric acid is not the cause of the tree; rather, the tree is the cause of the acid. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of everything. He is the cause of the tree that produces the citric acid (<span class="Italic">bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span>). Devotees can see that the original potencies causing the cosmic manifestation are not in chemicals but in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is the cause of the chemicals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything is caused or manifested by the energy of the Supreme Lord, and when everything is annihilated or dissolved, the original potency enters the body of the Supreme Lord. Therefore this verse says, <span class="Italic">ādāv ante ’pi ca sattvānāṁ yad dhruvaṁ tad evāntarāle ’pi.</span> The word <span class="Italic">dhruvam</span> means “permanent.” The permanent reality is Kṛṣṇa, not this cosmic manifestation. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> and <span class="Italic">mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of everything. Arjuna recognized Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the original person (<span class="Italic">puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum</span>), and the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> describes Him as the original person (<span class="Italic">govindam ādi-puruṣam</span>). He is the cause of all causes, whether at the beginning, at the end or in the middle.

            The origin of the material creation is Mahā-Viṣṇu, who lies in the Causal Ocean. While He sleeps in that ocean, millions of universes are generated as He exhales, and they are all annihilated when He inhales. This Mahā-Viṣṇu is a plenary portion of a portion of Viṣṇu, Govinda (<span class="Italic">yasya kalā-viśeṣaḥ</span>). The word <span class="Italic">kalā</span> refers to a plenary portion of a plenary portion. From Kṛṣṇa, or Govinda, comes Balarāma; from Balarāma comes Saṅkarṣaṇa; from Saṅkarṣaṇa, Nārāyaṇa; from Nārāyaṇa, the second Saṅkarṣaṇa; from the second Saṅkarṣaṇa, Mahā-Viṣṇu; from Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu; and from Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu controls every universe. This gives an idea of the meaning of <span class="Italic">ananta,</span> unlimited. What is to be said of the unlimited potency and existence of the Lord? This verse describes the coverings of the universe (<span class="Italic">saptabhir daśa-guṇottarair aṇḍa-kośaḥ</span>). The first covering is earth, the second is water, the third is fire, the fourth is air, the fifth is sky, the sixth is the total material energy, and the seventh is the false ego.

Even those who are obsessed with material desires may also come to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so steadily that they go back to Godhead. The fact is that if one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, although he may have many material desires, he becomes increasingly attracted to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa through associating with the Supreme Lord by chanting His holy name. The Supreme Lord and His holy name are identical. Thus he becomes uninterested in attachment to material enjoyment. The perfection of life is to be uninterested in material enjoyment and interested in Kṛṣṇa. If one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness somehow or other, even for material gain, the result is that he will be liberated. <span class="Italic">Kāmād dveṣād bhayāt snehāt.</span> Whether for the satisfaction of material desires, because of the influence of envy, because of fear, because of affection or because of any other reason, if one comes to Kṛṣṇa, his life is successful.

            Being full of contradictions, all forms of religion but bhāgavata-dharma work under conceptions of fruitive results and distinctions of “you and I” and “yours and mine.” The followers of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam have no such consciousness. They are all Kṛṣṇa conscious, thinking that they are Kṛṣṇa’s and Kṛṣṇa is theirs. There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are impure and temporary. Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.

            <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> has no contradictions. Conceptions of “your religion” and “my religion” are completely absent from <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> means following the orders given by the Supreme Lord, Bhagavān, as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> God is one, and God is for everyone. Therefore everyone must surrender to God. That is the pure conception of religion. Whatever God orders constitutes religion (<span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]). In <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span> there is no question of “what you believe” and “what I believe.” Everyone must believe in the Supreme Lord and carry out His orders. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam:</span> whatever Kṛṣṇa says—whatever God says—should be directly carried out. That is <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            If one is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, he cannot have any enemies. Since his only engagement is to induce others to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, or God, how can he have enemies? If one advocates the Hindu religion, the Muslim religion, the Christian religion, this religion or that religion, there will be conflicts. History shows that the followers of religious systems without a clear conception of God have fought with one another. There are many instances of this in human history, but systems of religion that do not concentrate upon service to the Supreme are temporary and cannot last for long because they are full of envy. There are many activities directed against such religious systems, and therefore one must give up the idea of “my belief” and “your belief.” Everyone should believe in God and surrender unto Him. That is <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Bhāgavata-dharma is not a concocted sectarian belief, for it entails research to find how everything is connected with Kṛṣṇa (<span class="Italic">īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam</span>). According to the Vedic injunctions, <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma:</span> Brahman, the Supreme, is present in everything. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> captures this presence of the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> does not consider everything in the world to be false. Because everything emanates from the Supreme, nothing can be false; everything has some use in the service of the Supreme. For example, we are now dictating into a microphone and recording on a dictating machine, and thus we are finding how the machine can be connected to the Supreme Brahman. Since we are using this machine in the service of the Lord, it is Brahman. This is the meaning of <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> Everything is Brahman because everything can be used for the service of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> false; everything is factual.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> is called <span class="Italic">sarvotkṛṣṭa,</span> the best of all religious systems, because those who follow <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span> are not envious of anyone. Pure <span class="Italic">bhāgavatas,</span> pure devotees, invite everyone, without envy, to join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. A devotee is therefore exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām:</span> he is the friend of all living entities. Therefore this is the best of all religious systems. Whereas so-called religions are meant for a particular type of person who believes in a particular way, such discrimination has no place in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span> If we scrutinize the religious systems meant for worship of demigods or anyone else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that they are full of envy and therefore impure.

            Any religious system but the process of <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span>—service as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—is a system of envy of one’s own self and of others. For example, there are many systems of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended. Such animal sacrifices are inauspicious both for the performer and for the animal. Although one is sometimes permitted to sacrifice an animal before the goddess Kālī and eat it instead of purchasing meat from a slaughterhouse, permission to eat meat after a sacrifice in the presence of the goddess Kālī is not the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is simply a concession for the miserable person who will not give up eating meat. It is meant to restrict his desire for unrestricted meat-eating. Such a religious system is condemned. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</span> [Bg. 18.66] “Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me.” That is the last word in religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            One may argue that the sacrifice of animals is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> This recommendation, however, is a restriction. Without Vedic restrictions on the purchase of meat, people will purchase meat from the market, which will be overflooded with meat shops, and slaughterhouses will increase. To restrict this, sometimes the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say that one may eat meat after sacrificing an insignificant animal like a goat before the goddess Kālī. In any case, a system of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended is inauspicious for those who perform the sacrifices and for the animals. Envious persons who perform ostentatious animal sacrifices are condemned in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (16.17) as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">ātma-sambhāvitāḥ stabdhā<br>dhana-māna-madānvitāḥ<br>yajante nāma-yajñais te<br>dambhenāvidhi-pūrvakam</div>

          <p>
            “Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations.” Sometimes animal sacrifices are performed very gorgeously with grand arrangements for worshiping the goddess Kālī, but such festivals, although performed in the name of <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> are not actually <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> for <span class="Italic">yajña</span> means to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is recommended that in this age specifically, <span class="Italic">yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:</span> [SB 11.5.32] those who have good intelligence satisfy the <span class="Italic">yajña-puruṣa,</span> Viṣṇu, by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Envious persons, however, are condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as follows:

            “Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.” (Bg. 16.18–19) These persons are condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as indicated by the words <span class="Italic">tava kopaḥ.</span> A person who commits murder is envious of himself and also the person he has killed, for the result of committing murder is that he will be arrested and hanged. If one transgresses the laws of a man-made government, he may escape being killed by the state, but one cannot escape the laws of God. A killer of any animal must be killed in his next life by the same animal. This is the law of nature. One must follow the instructions of the Supreme Lord: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one follows any other system of religion, he is subject to punishment by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in many different ways. Therefore if one follows a concocted system of religion, he is envious not only of others but also of himself. Consequently his system of religion is useless.

            <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> means living according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we find that the Supreme Lord has arranged human society in four social divisions, namely <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Again, the <span class="Italic">Purāṇas</span> and other Vedic literatures set forth four <span class="Italic">āśramas,</span> which are the divisions of spiritual life. Therefore <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span> means the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> of the four social and four spiritual divisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The members of human society who strictly follow the principles of <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span> and live according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called Āryans or <span class="Italic">ārya.</span> A civilization of Āryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those instructions is perfect. Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and other living entities. <span class="Italic">paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ: [Bg. </span>5.18] because they are completely educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they see all living beings equally. Āryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification. At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is prominent. Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also, all for sense gratification. This is not an Āryan civilization. As stated here, <span class="Italic">sthira-cara-sattva-kadambeṣv apṛthag-dhiyaḥ.</span> The word <span class="Italic">apṛthag-dhiyaḥ</span> indicates that Āryans do not distinguish between lower and higher grades of life. All life should be protected. All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and plants. This is the basic principle of an Āryan civilization. Apart from the lower living entities, those who have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and other Vedic literatures. The criterion must be <span class="Italic">guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">karma.</span> In other words, one should acquire the qualities of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> or <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> and act accordingly. This is the civilization accepted by the Āryans. Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very much eager to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. This is perfect civilization.

          <p>
            Āryans do not deviate from the instructions of Kṛṣṇa, nor do they have doubts about Kṛṣṇa, but non-Āryans and other demoniac people fail to follow the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> This is because they have been trained in sense gratification at the cost of all other living entities. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma: [SB </span>5.5.4] their only business is to indulge in all kinds of forbidden activities for sense gratification. <span class="Italic">Yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti:</span> they deviate in this way because they want to gratify their senses.

Their method of civilization is condemned in the previous verse. <span class="Italic">Kaḥ kṣemo nija-parayoḥ kiyān vārthaḥ sva-para-druhā dharmeṇa:</span> “What is the meaning of a civilization that kills oneself and others?”
          </p>
          <p>
            This verse, therefore, advises that everyone become a member of the Āryan civilization and accept the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should conduct his social, political and religious affairs according to His instructions. We are spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to try to establish a society the way that Kṛṣṇa wants it. This is the meaning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are therefore presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is and kicking out all kinds of mental concoction. Fools and rascals interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in their own way. When Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]—“Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me”—they comment that it is not Kṛṣṇa to whom we must surrender. Thus they derive imaginary meanings from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, however, strictly follows <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma,</span> the instructions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> for the complete welfare of human society. One who misinterprets <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> twisting out some meaning for his sense gratification, is a non-Āryan. Therefore commentaries on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> by such persons should be immediately rejected. One should try to follow <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (12.6–7) Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa says:

            The science of devotional service has been instructed by Nārada and Aṅgirā to Citraketu. Now, because of Citraketu’s devotional service, he has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By performing devotional service, one advances step by step, and when one is on the platform of love of Godhead (<span class="Italic">premā pumartho mahān</span>) he sees the Supreme Lord at every moment. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> when one engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day (<span class="Italic">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam [Bg. </span>10.10]) in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master, his devotional service becomes more and more pleasing. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is within the core of everyone’s heart, speaks to the devotee (<span class="Italic">dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te</span>). Citraketu Mahārāja was first instructed by his <span class="Italic">gurus,</span> Aṅgirā and Nārada, and now, having followed their instructions, he has come to the stage of seeing the Supreme Lord face to face. Therefore the Lord is now instructing him in the essence of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The essence of knowledge is that there are two kinds of <span class="Italic">vastu,</span> or substances, One is real, and the other, being illusory or temporary, is sometimes called nonfactual. One must consider these two kinds of existence. The real <span class="Italic">tattva,</span> or truth, consists of Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.2.11):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br>tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam<br>brahmeti paramātmeti<br>bhagavān iti śabdyate</div>

            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān.” The Absolute Truth exists eternally in three features. Therefore, Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān combined are the substance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The categories of emanations from the nonsubstance are two—activities and forbidden activities (<span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">vikarma</span>). <span class="Italic">Karma</span> refers to the pious life or material activities performed during the day and the mental activities of dreams at night. These are more or less desired activities. <span class="Italic">Vikarma,</span> however, refers to illusory activities, which are something like the will-o’-the-wisp. These are activities that have no meaning. For example, modern scientists imagine that life can be produced from chemical combinations, and they are very busy trying to prove this in laboratories throughout the world, although no one in history has been able to produce the substance of life from material combinations. Such activities are called <span class="Italic">vikarma.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            All material activities are actually illusory, and progress in illusion is simply a waste of time. These illusory activities are called <span class="Italic">akārya,</span> and one must learn of them from the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.17):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          <p>
            “The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.” One must learn of these directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, as Anantadeva, is instructing King Citraketu because of the advanced stage of devotional service he achieved by following the instructions of Nārada and Aṅgirā.

Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of the living entities, who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.” The living entity tries to lord it over the material or physical elements, but both the physical elements and the spiritual spark are energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ vai sarva-bhūtāni:</span> “I am everything.” Just as heat and light emanate from fire, these two energies—the physical elements and the living entities—emanate from the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Lord says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ vai sarva-bhūtāni:</span> “I expand the physical and spiritual categories.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, the Lord, as the Supersoul, guides the living entities who are conditioned by the physical atmosphere. Therefore he is called <span class="Italic">bhūtātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ.</span> He gives the living entity the intelligence with which to improve his position so that he may return home, back to Godhead, or if he does not want to go back to Godhead, the Lord gives him the intelligence with which to improve his material position. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.15). <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:</span> “I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.” From within, the Lord gives the living being the intelligence with which to work. Therefore the previous verse said that after the Supreme Personality of Godhead endeavors, our endeavors begin. We cannot independently endeavor or act upon anything. Therefore the Lord is <span class="Italic">bhūta-bhāvanaḥ.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another specific feature of the knowledge given in this verse is that <span class="Italic">śabda-brahma</span> is also a form of the Supreme Lord. In His eternal, blissful form, Lord Kṛṣṇa is accepted by Arjuna as <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma.</span> A living entity in the conditioned stage accepts something illusory as substantial. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā</span> or <span class="Italic">avidyā</span>—ignorance. Therefore according to the Vedic knowledge, one must become a devotee, and one must then distinguish between <span class="Italic">avidyā</span> and <span class="Italic">vidyā,</span> which are elaborately explained in the <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span> When one is actually on the platform of <span class="Italic">vidyā,</span> he can personally understand the Personality of Godhead in His forms like those of Lord Rāma, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Saṅkarṣaṇa. The Vedic knowledge is described as the breathing of the Supreme Lord, and activities begin on the basis of Vedic knowledge. Therefore the Lord says that when He endeavors or breathes, the material universes come into existence, and various activities gradually develop. The Lord says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu:</span> “I am the syllable <span class="Italic">oṁ</span> in all the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras.</span>” Vedic knowledge begins with the vibration of the transcendental sound <span class="Italic">praṇava, oṁkāra.</span> The same transcendental sound is Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. <span class="Italic">Abhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ:</span> there is no difference between the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself.

            The Māyāvāda philosophy sees everything as being equal in quality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Supreme Brahman, and therefore sees everything as worshipable. This dangerous theory of the Māyāvāda school has turned people in general toward atheism. On the strength of this theory, one thinks that he is God, but this is not a fact. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (<span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā</span>), the fact is that the entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord’s energies, which are manifested in the physical elements and the living entities. The living entities wrongly consider the physical elements to be resources meant for their enjoyment, and they think themselves to be the enjoyers. However, neither of them is independent; they are both energies of the Lord. The original cause for the material energy and spiritual energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, although the expansion of the Lord’s energies is the original cause, one should not think that the Lord Himself has expanded in different ways. To condemn the theories of the Māyāvādīs, the Lord clearly says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ:</span> “All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.” Everything rests upon Him, and everything is but an expansion of His energies, but this does not mean that everything is as worshipable as the Lord Himself. The material expansion is temporary, but the Lord is not temporary. The living entities are parts of the Lord, but they are not the Lord Himself. The living entities in this material world are not inconceivable, but the Lord is. The theory that the Lord’s energies, being expansions of the Lord, are as good as the Lord is mistaken.

            When a person is in deep sleep, he dreams and sees in himself many other objects, such as great mountains and rivers or perhaps even the entire universe, although they are far away. Sometimes when one awakens from a dream he sees that he is in a human form, lying in his bed in one place. Then he sees himself, in terms of various conditions, as belonging to a particular nationality, family and so on. All the conditions of deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness are but energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should always remember the original creator of these conditions, the Supreme Lord, who is unaffected by them.

            None of these conditions of the living entities—namely, deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness—is substantial. They are simply displays of various phases of conditional life. There may be many mountains, rivers, trees, bees, tigers and snakes that are situated far away, but in a dream one may imagine them to be nearby. Similarly, as one has subtle dreams at night, when the living entity is awake he lives in gross dreams of nation, community, society, possessions, skyscrapers, bank balance, position and honor. Under the circumstances, one should know that his position is due to his contact with the material world. One is situated in different positions in various forms of life that are all but creations of the illusory energy, which works under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the ultimate actor, and the conditioned living entity should simply remember this original actor, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. As living entities, we are being carried away by the waves of <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> or nature, which works under the Lord’s direction (<span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10]</span>). Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings, <span class="Italic">(miche) māyāra vaśe, yāccha bhese’, khāccha hābuḍubu, bhāi:</span> “Why are you being carried away by the waves of the illusory energy in various phases of dreaming and wakefulness? These are all creations of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>” Our only duty is to remember the supreme director of this illusory energy—Kṛṣṇa. For us to do this, the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> advises us, <span class="Italic">harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam</span> [Adi 17.21]<span class="Italic">:</span> one should constantly chant the holy name of the Lord—Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. The Supreme Lord is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, but Bhagavān is the ultimate realization. One who realizes Bhagavān—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa—is the most perfect <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> (<span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]). In the human form of life, one should understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for then one will understand everything else. <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> According to this Vedic injunction, simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa one understands Brahman, Paramātmā, <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> the illusory energy, the spiritual energy and everything else. Everything will be revealed. <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> the material nature, is. working under the direction of the Supreme Lord, and we living entities are being carried away by various phases of <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span> For self-realization, one should always remember Kṛṣṇa. As stated in <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa, smartavyaḥ satataṁ viṣṇuḥ:</span> we should always remember Lord Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Vismartavyo na jātucit:</span> we should never forget the Lord. This is the perfection of life.

            If one’s dreams during sleep are merely subject matters witnessed by the Supersoul, how can the living entity, who is different from the Supersoul, remember the activities of dreams? The experiences of one person cannot be understood by another. Therefore the knower of the facts, the living entity who inquires into the incidents manifested in dreams and wakefulness, is different from the circumstantial activities. That knowing factor is Brahman. In other words, the quality of knowing belongs to the living entities and to the Supreme Soul. Thus the living entity can also experience the activities of dreams and wakefulness. In both stages the knower is unchanged, but is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman.

            When a living entity, thinking himself different from Me, forgets his spiritual identity of qualitative oneness with Me in eternity, knowledge and bliss, his material, conditional life begins. In other words, instead of identifying his interest with Mine, he becomes interested in his bodily expansions like his wife, children and material possessions. In this way, by the influence of his actions, one body comes from another, and after one death, another death takes place.

            Generally the Māyāvādī philosophers or persons influenced by Māyāvādī philosophers think themselves as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the cause of their conditional life. As stated by the Vaiṣṇava poet Jagadānanda Paṇḍita in his <span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare<br>nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare</div>

          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as a living entity forgets his constitutional position and endeavors to become one with the Supreme, his conditional life begins. The conception that the Supreme Brahman and the living entity are equal not only in quality but also in quantity is the cause of conditional life. If one forgets the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entity, his conditional life begins. Conditional life means giving up one body to accept another and undergoing death to accept death again. The Māyāvādī philosopher teaches the philosophy of <span class="Italic">tat tvam asi,</span> saying, “You are the same as God.” He forgets that <span class="Italic">tat tvam asi</span> applies in terms of the marginal position of the living entity, who is like sunshine. There is heat and light in the sun, and there is heat and light in the sunshine, and thus they are qualitatively one. But one should not forget that the sunshine rests on the sun. As the Lord says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham [Bg. </span>14.27<span class="Italic">]:</span> “I am the original source of Brahman.” The sunshine is important because of the presence of the sun globe. It is not that the sun globe is important because of the all-pervasiveness of the sunshine. Forgetfulness and misunderstanding of this fact is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Because of forgetfulness of one’s constitutional position and that of the Supreme Lord, one comes into <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> or <span class="Italic">saṁsāra</span>—conditional life. In this regard, Madhvācārya says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">sarva-bhinnaṁ parātmānaṁ<br>vismaran saṁsared iha<br>abhinnaṁ saṁsmaran yāti<br>tamo nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ</div>
