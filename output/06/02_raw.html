<A NAME="76026"></A><div id="76026"> </div>
<div class="Chapter-Desc">Aj&#257;mila Delivered by the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas</div>
<A NAME="76028"></A><div id="76028"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter the messengers from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha explain to the Yamad&#363;tas the glories of chanting the holy name of the Lord. The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas said, &ldquo;Now impious acts are being performed even in an assembly of devotees, for a person who is not punishable is going to be punished in the assembly of Yamar&#257;ja. The mass of people are helpless and must depend upon the government for their safety and security, but if the government takes advantage of this to harm the citizens, where will they go? We see perfectly that Aj&#257;mila should not be punished, although you are attempting to take him to Yamar&#257;ja for punishment.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="76029"></A><div id="76029"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">It was due to Aj&#257;mila&rsquo;s glorifying the holy name of the Supreme Lord that he was not punishable. The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas explained this as follows: &ldquo;Simply by once chanting the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, this <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> has become free from the reactions of sinful life. Indeed, he has been freed not only from the sins of this life, but from the sins of many, many thousands of other lives. He has already undergone true atonement for all his sinful actions. If one atones according to the directions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> one does not actually become free from sinful reactions, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, even a glimpse of such chanting can immediately free one from all sins. Chanting the glories of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name awakens all good fortune. Therefore there is no doubt that Aj&#257;mila, being completely free from all sinful reactions, should not be punished by Yamar&#257;ja.&rdquo;</div>
</div><A NAME="76030"></A><div id="76030"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">As they were saying this, the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas released Aj&#257;mila from the ropes of the Yamad&#363;tas and left for their own abode. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> Aj&#257;mila, however, offered his respectful obeisances to the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas. He could understand how fortunate he was to have chanted the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a at the end of his life. Indeed, he could realize the full significance of this good fortune. Having thoroughly understood the discussion between the Yamad&#363;tas and the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, he became a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He lamented very much for how very sinful he had been, and he condemned himself again and again.</div>
</div><A NAME="76031"></A><div id="76031"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Finally, because of his association with the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, Aj&#257;mila, his original consciousness aroused, gave up everything and went to Hardwar, where he engaged in devotional service without deviation, always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas went there, seated him on a golden throne and took him away to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka.</div>
</div><A NAME="76032"></A><div id="76032"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In summary, although the sinful Aj&#257;mila meant to call his son, the holy name of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, even though chanted in the preliminary stage, <span class="Italic">n&#257;m&#257;bh&#257;sa,</span> was able to give him liberation. Therefore one who chants the holy name of the Lord with faith and devotion is certainly exalted. He is protected even in his material, conditional life.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas said: Alas, how painful it is that irreligion is being introduced into an assembly where religion should be maintained. Indeed, those in charge of maintaining the religious principles are needlessly punishing a sinless, unpunishable person.</div>

<div class="First">The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas accused the Yamad&#363;tas of violating the religious principles by attempting to drag Aj&#257;mila to Yamar&#257;ja for punishment. Yamar&#257;ja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish people who are irreligious. However, if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamar&#257;ja is contaminated. This principle applies not only in the assembly of Yamar&#257;ja, but throughout human society also.</div>
<A NAME="76061"></A><div id="76061"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In human society, properly maintaining religious principles is the duty of the king&rsquo;s court or the government. Unfortunately, in this <span class="Italic">yuga,</span> Kali-yuga, the religious principles are tampered with, and the government cannot properly judge who is to be punished and who is not. It is said that in the Kali-yuga if one cannot spend money in court, one cannot get justice. Indeed, in courts of justice it is often found that magistrates are bribed for favorable judgments. Sometimes religious men who preach the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement for the benefit of the entire populace are arrested and harassed by the police and courts. The Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, who are Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, lamented for these very regrettable facts. Because of their spiritual compassion for all the fallen souls, Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas go out to preach according to the standard method of all religious principles, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas who have dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord are sometimes harassed and punished by courts on false charges of disturbing the peace.</div>

<div class="Translation">A king or governmental official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer and protector of the citizens because of affection and love. He should give the citizens good advice and instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone. Yamar&#257;ja does this, for he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his footsteps. However, if such persons become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an innocent, blameless person, where will the citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?</div>

<div class="First">The king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian of the citizens by teaching them the proper goal of life. The human form of life is especially meant for realization of one&rsquo;s self and one&rsquo;s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because this cannot be realized in animal life. The duty of the government, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a way that by a gradual process they will be elevated to the spiritual platform and will realize the self and his relationship with God. This principle was followed by kings like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, Lord R&#257;macandra, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. The leaders of the government must be very honest and religious because otherwise all the affairs of the state will suffer. Unfortunately, in the name of democracy, rogues and thieves are electing other rogues and thieves to the most important posts in the government. Recently this has been proven in America, where the president had to be condemned and dragged down from his post by the citizens. This is only one case, but there are many others. Because of the importance of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, people should be K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and should not vote for anyone who is not K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. Then there will be actual peace and prosperity in the state. When a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava sees mismanagement in the government, he feels great compassion in his heart and tries his best to purify the situation by spreading the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement.</div>

The Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement is the right movement for ameliorating the fallen condition of human society, and therefore governments and public leaders in every part of the world should support this movement to completely rectify humanity&rsquo;s sinful condition.</div>

<div class="Translation">People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by which to discriminate between religion and irreligion. The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master&rsquo;s protection. If a leader is actually kindhearted and deserves to be the object of a living entity&rsquo;s faith, how can he punish or kill a foolish person who has fully surrendered in good faith and friendship?</div>

<div class="First">The Sanskrit word <span class="Italic">vi&#347;vasta-gh&#257;ta</span> refers to one who breaks faith or causes a breach of trust. The mass of people should always feel security because of the government&rsquo;s protection. Therefore, how regrettable it is for the government itself to cause a breach of trust and put the citizens in difficulty for political reasons. We actually saw during the partition days in India that although Hindus and Muslims were living together peacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred between them, and thus the Hindus and Muslims killed one another over politics. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In this age, animals are kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter. Such cruelty is condemned by Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas like the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas. Indeed, the hellish conditions already described await the sinful men responsible for such suffering. One who betrays the confidence of a living entity who takes shelter of him in good faith, whether that living entity be a human being or an animal, is extremely sinful. Because such betrayals now go unpunished by the government, all of human society is terribly contaminated. The people of this age are therefore described as <span class="Italic">mand&#257;&#7717; sumanda-matayo manda-bh&#257;gy&#257; hy upadrut&#257;&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/10?d=1">1.1.10</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> As a consequence of such sinfulness, men are condemned (<span class="Italic">mand&#257;&#7717;</span>), their intelligence is unclear (<span class="Italic">sumanda-mataya&#7717;</span>), they are unfortunate (<span class="Italic">manda-bh&#257;gy&#257;&#7717;</span>), and therefore they are always disturbed by many problems (<span class="Italic">upadrut&#257;&#7717;</span>). This is their situation in this life, and after death they are punished in hellish conditions.</div>

One who always chants the holy name of the Lord without offenses is always pure. As confirmed in this verse Aj&#257;mila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a he remained sinless. It did not matter that he was calling his son; the name itself was effective.</div>

There are twenty types of religious scriptures called <span class="Italic">dharma-&#347;&#257;stras,</span> beginning with the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">par&#257;&#347;ara-sa&#7745;hit&#257;,</span> but herein it is stressed that although one may become free from the reactions of the most sinful activities by following the religious principles of these scriptures, this cannot promote a sinful man to the stage of loving service to the Lord. On the other hand, chanting the holy name of the Lord even once not only frees one immediately from the reactions of the greatest sins, but also raises one to the platform of rendering loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described as <span class="Italic">uttama&#347;loka</span> because He is famous for His glorious activities. Thus one serves the Lord by remembering His form, His attributes and pastimes. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura explains that this is all possible simply by chanting the Lord&rsquo;s holy name because of the Lord&rsquo;s omnipotence. What cannot be achieved through the performance of Vedic rituals can be easily achieved through the chanting of the Lord&rsquo;s holy name. To chant the holy name and dance in ecstasy is so easy and sublime that one can achieve all the benefits of spiritual life simply by following this process.

<div class="Translation">The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one&rsquo;s mind again runs toward material activities. Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a mantra, or glorification of the name, fame and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting eradicates the dirt from one&rsquo;s heart completely.</div>

S&#257;mba fell in love with the daughter of Duryodhana, and since according to <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> custom one is not offered a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya&rsquo;s</span> daughter unless he displays his chivalrous valor, S&#257;mba abducted her. Consequently S&#257;mba was arrested by the Kauravas. Later, when Lord Balar&#257;ma came to rescue him, there was an argument about S&#257;mba&rsquo;s release. Since the argument was not settled, Balar&#257;ma showed His power in such a way that all of Hastin&#257;pura trembled and would have been vanquished as if by a great earthquake.

<div class="First">In the Western countries, where the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement is spreading, learned scholars and other thoughtful men are realizing its effectiveness. For example, Dr. J. Stillson Judah, a learned scholar, has been very much attracted to this movement because he has actually seen that it is turning hippies addicted to drugs into pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas who voluntarily become servants of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and humanity. Even a few years ago, such hippies did not know the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> but now they are chanting it and becoming pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Thus they are becoming free from all sinful activities, such as illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. This is practical proof of the effectiveness of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a movement, which is supported in this verse. One may or may not know the value of chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> but if one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be purified, just as one who takes a potent medicine will feel its effects, regardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly.</div>

To increase his eagerness to glorify the Lord, they disappeared so that he would feel separation in their absence. In the mode of separation, glorification of the Lord is very intense.</div>

<div class="Translation">After hearing the discourses between the Yamad&#363;tas and the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas, Aj&#257;mila could understand the religious principles that act under the three modes of material nature. These principles are mentioned in the three Vedas. He could also understand the transcendental religious principles, which are above the modes of material nature and which concern the relationship between the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, Aj&#257;mila heard glorification of the name, fame, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He thus became a perfectly pure devotee. He could then remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.&rdquo; The Vedic principles certainly prescribe a gradual process for rising to the spiritual platform, but if one remains attached to the Vedic principles, there is no chance of his being elevated to spiritual life. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a therefore advised Arjuna to perform devotional service, which is the process of transcendental religion. The transcendental position of devotional service is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/6?d=1">1.2.6</a>). <span class="Italic">Sa vai pu&#7745;s&#257;&#7745; paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok&#7779;aje.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti,</span> devotional service, is <span class="Italic">paro dharma&#7717;,</span> transcendental <span class="Italic">dharma;</span> it is not material <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> People generally think that religion should be pursued for material profit.

The <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata</span> religion teaches that the Lord and the living entity are eternally related and that the duty of the living entity is to surrender to the Lord. When one is situated on the platform of devotional service, one is freed from impediments and completely satisfied (<span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihat&#257; yay&#257;tm&#257; supras&#299;dati</span>). Having been elevated to that platform, Aj&#257;mila began to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Association with devotees is recommended by all the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> because by even a moment of such association one can receive the seed for all perfection.&rdquo; In the beginning of his life Aj&#257;mila was certainly very pure, and he associated with devotees and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as;</span> because of that pious activity, even though he was fallen, he was inspired to name his son N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. Certainly this was due to good counsel given from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j�&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;I am seated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; The Lord, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, is so kind that if one has ever rendered service to Him, the Lord never forgets him. Thus the Lord, from within, gave Aj&#257;mila the opportunity to name his youngest son N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a so that in affection he would constantly call &ldquo;N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a! N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a!&rdquo; and thus be saved from the most fearful and dangerous condition at the time of his death. Such is the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. <span class="Italic">Guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja:</span> by the mercy of the <span class="Italic">guru</span> and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one receives the seed of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> This association saves a devotee from the greatest fear. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee&rsquo;s name to a form that reminds him of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;ad&#257;sa or Govinda d&#257;sa, he can be saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is essential. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to remember K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a somehow or other.</div>

<div class="Translation">Simply because I chanted the holy name of the Lord in the association of devotees, my heart is now becoming purified. Therefore I shall not fall victim again to the false lures of material sense gratification. Now that I have become fixed in the Absolute Truth, henceforward I shall not identify myself with the body. I shall give up false conceptions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and fix my mind on the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>

<div class="First">How a living entity becomes a victim of the material condition is lucidly explained in this verse. The beginning is to misidentify the body as one&rsquo;s self. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> begins with the spiritual instruction that one is not the body, but is within the body. This consciousness can be possible only if one chants the holy name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> and always keeps oneself in the association of devotees. This is the secret of success. Therefore we stress that one should chant the holy name of the Lord and keep oneself free from the contaminations of this material world, especially the contaminations of lusty desires for illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. With determination, one should vow to follow these principles and thus be saved from the miserable condition of material existence. The first necessity is to become freed from the bodily concept of life.</div>

<div class="Translation">Aj&#257;mila was a br&#257;hma&#7751;a who because of bad association had given up all brahminical culture and religious principles.

<div class="Translation">Therefore one who desires freedom from material bondage should adopt the process of chanting and glorifying the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the holy places stand. One cannot derive the proper benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement, speculative knowledge and meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods one takes to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of nature, namely passion and ignorance.</div>

<div class="First">It has actually been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, many <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s, j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> become attached to material activities again. Many so-called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> give up material activities as false (<span class="Italic">jagan mithy&#257;</span>), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public. Sometimes they participate in politics, although still falsely declaring themselves <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> members of the renounced order. The perfect conclusion, however, is that if one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to devotional service, which begins with <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717;: </I>[SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/23-24?d=1">7.5.23</a>] chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has actually proved this. In the Western countries, many young boys who were addicted to drugs and who had many other bad habits, which they could not give up, abandoned all those propensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord as soon as they joined the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. In other words, this process is the perfect method of atonement for actions performed in <span class="Italic">raja&#7717;</span> and <span class="Italic">tama&#7717;</span> (passion and ignorance). As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/19?d=1">1.2.19</a>):</div>

<div class="First">At the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are in disorder. At that time, even one who throughout his life has practiced chanting the holy name of the Lord may not be able to chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> very distinctly. Nevertheless, such a person receives all the benefits of chanting the holy name. While the body is fit therefore, why should we not chant the holy name of the Lord loudly and distinctly? If one does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be properly able to chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith. In conclusion, one who chants the holy name of the Lord constantly is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt.</div>

<A NAME="76690"></A><div id="76690"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Someone may say, &ldquo;It may be accepted that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes freed from all the reactions of sinful life. However, if one commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only once but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions of such sins even after atoning for them for twelve years or more. How is it possible, then, that simply by once chanting the holy name of the Lord one immediately becomes freed from the reactions of such sins?&rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="76691"></A><div id="76691"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura replies by quoting verses nine and ten of this chapter: &ldquo;The chanting of the holy name of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> or for one who indulges in sex with the wife of his <span class="Italic">guru</span> or another superior. It is also the best method of atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, such sinful persons may attract the attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers &ldquo;Because this man has chanted My holy name, My duty is to give him protection.&rsquo; &rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="76692"></A><div id="76692"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One may atone for sinful life and vanquish all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name, although this is not called atonement. Ordinary atonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not completely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts. Therefore atonement is not as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is said that if a person only once chants the holy name and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord immediately considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him protection. This is confirmed by &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;. Thus when Aj&#257;mila was in great danger of being carried off by the order carriers of Yamar&#257;ja, the Lord immediately sent His personal order carriers to protect him, and because Aj&#257;mila was freed from all sinful reactions, the Vi&#7779;&#7751;ud&#363;tas spoke on his behalf.</div>
<A NAME="76693"></A><div id="76693"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Aj&#257;mila had named his son N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and because he loved the boy very much, he would call him again and again. Although he was calling for his son, the name itself was powerful because the name N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is not different from the Supreme Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. When Aj&#257;mila named his son N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, all the reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling his son and thus chanting the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a thousands of times, he was actually unconsciously advancing in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>
<A NAME="76694"></A><div id="76694"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One may argue, &ldquo;Since he was constantly chanting the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, how was it possible for him to be associating with a prostitute and thinking of wine?&rdquo; By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering upon himself again and again, and therefore one may say that his ultimate chanting of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a was the cause of his being freed. However, his chanting would then have been a <span class="Italic">n&#257;ma-apar&#257;dha.</span> <span class="Italic">N&#257;mno bal&#257;d yasya hi p&#257;pa-buddhi&#7717;:</span> one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his sins by chanting the holy name of the Lord is a <span class="Italic">n&#257;ma-apar&#257;dh&#299;,</span> an offender to the holy name. In response it may be said that Aj&#257;mila&rsquo;s chanting was inoffensive because he did not chant the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a with the purpose of counteracting his sins. He did not know that he was addicted to sinful actions, nor did he know that his chanting of the name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a was neutralizing them. Thus he did not commit a <span class="Italic">n&#257;ma-apar&#257;dha,</span> and his repeated chanting of the holy name of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a while calling his son may be called pure chanting. Because of this pure chanting, Aj&#257;mila unconsciously accumulated the results of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Indeed, even his first utterance of the holy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life. To cite a logical example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time the fruits are available. Similarly, Aj&#257;mila&rsquo;s devotional service grew little by little, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the reactions did not affect him. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is said that if one chants the holy name of the Lord even once, the reactions of past, present or future sinful life do not affect him. To give another example, if one extracts the poison fangs of a serpent, this saves the serpent&rsquo;s future victims from poisonous effects, even if the serpent bites repeatedly. Similarly, if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this protects him eternally. He need only wait for the results of the chanting to mature in due course of time.</div>
