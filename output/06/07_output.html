          <div class="Normal-Level">As related in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, committed an offense at the feet of his spiritual master, Bṛhaspati. Bṛhaspati therefore left the demigods, who then had no priest. However, at the request of the demigods, Viśvarūpa, the son of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> Tvaṣṭā, became their priest.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">Once upon a time, Indra, the King of the demigods, was sitting with his wife Śacīdevī and being praised by various demigods like the Siddhas, Cāraṇas and Gandharvas when Bṛhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, entered the assembly. Indra, being too absorbed in material opulence, forgot himself and did not respect Bṛhaspati, who thus became aware of Indra’s pride in his material opulence and immediately disappeared from the assembly to teach him a lesson. Indra became most repentant, understanding that because of his opulence he had forgotten to respect his spiritual master. He left the palace to beg pardon from his spiritual master, but could not find Bṛhaspati anywhere.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">Because of his disrespectful behavior toward his spiritual master. Indra lost all his opulence and was conquered by the demons, who defeated the demigods in a great fight and occupied Indra’s throne. King Indra, along with the other demigods, later took shelter of Lord Brahmā. Understanding the situation, Lord Brahmā chastised the demigods for their offense to their spiritual master. Following Lord Brahmā’s orders, the demigods accepted Viśvarūpa, who was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and the son of Tvaṣṭā, as their priest. Then they performed <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> under the priesthood of Viśvarūpa and were able to conquer the demons.</div>

            Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O King, once upon a time, the King of heaven, Indra, being extremely proud because of his great opulence of the three worlds, transgressed the law of Vedic etiquette. Seated on his throne, he was surrounded by the Maruts, Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas, Ṛbhus, Viśvadevas, Sādhyas, Aśvinī-kumāras, Siddhas, Cāraṇas and Gandharvas and by great saintly persons. Also surrounding him were the Vidyādharas, Apsarās, Kinnaras, Patagas [birds] and Uragas [snakes]. All of them were offering Indra their respects and services, and the Apsarās and Gandharvas were dancing and singing with very sweet musical instruments. Over Indra’s head was a white umbrella as effulgent as the full moon. Fanned by yak-tail whisks and served with all the paraphernalia of a great king, Indra was sitting with his wife, Śacīdevī, who occupied half the throne, when the great sage Bṛhaspati appeared in that assembly. Bṛhaspati, the best of the sages, was the spiritual master of Indra and the demigods and was respected by the demigods and demons alike. Nevertheless, although Indra saw his spiritual master before him, he did not rise from his own seat or offer a seat to his spiritual master, nor did Indra offer him a respectful welcome. Indra did nothing to show him respect.

            Bṛhaspati knew everything that would happen in the future. Seeing Indra’s transgression of etiquette, he completely understood that Indra was puffed up by his material opulence. Although able to curse Indra, he did not do so. Instead, he left the assembly and in silence returned to his home.

            Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu prayed to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <span class="Italic">na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye:</span> “O my Lord, I do not aspire for material opulence or wealth, nor do I want a great number of followers to accept me as their leader, nor do I want a very beautiful wife to please me.” <span class="Italic">Mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi:</span> “I do not even want liberation. All I want, life after life, is to be a faithful servant of Your Lordship.” According to the laws of nature, when one is extremely opulent one becomes degraded, and this is true both individually and collectively. The demigods are situated in the mode of goodness, but sometimes even one who is situated in such an exalted position as King Indra, the king of all the demigods, falls down because of material opulence. We are now actually seeing this in America. The entire American nation has tried to advance in material opulence without striving to produce ideal human beings. The result is that Americans are now regretting the wholesale criminality of American society and are wondering how America has become so lawless and unmanageable. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (7.5.31), <span class="Italic">na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum:</span> persons who are unenlightened do not know the aim of life, which is to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore, both individually and collectively, they try to enjoy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted to wine and women. The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class. They are the unwanted population known as <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara,</span> and as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> an increase of <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara</span> population creates a hellish society. This is the society in which Americans now find themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, however, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement has come to America, and many fortunate young men are giving serious attention to this movement, which is creating ideal men of first-class character, men who completely refrain from meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. If the American people are serious about curbing the degraded criminal life of their nation, they must take to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (<span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]). They must divide their society into first-class men, second-class men, third-class men and fourth-class men. Since they are now creating only men who are less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra regretted his disrespect to his spiritual master, Bṛhaspati. Similarly, it is advised that the American people regret their mistaken advancement in civilization. They should take advice from the spiritual master, the representative of Kṛṣṇa. If they do so, they will be happy, and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead the entire world.

            If a person says, “One who is situated on the exalted throne of a king should not stand up to show respect to another king or a brāhmaṇa,” it is to be understood that he does not know the superior religious principles.

            Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says in this regard that when a president or king is sitting on his throne, he does not need to show respect to everyone who comes within his assembly, but he must show respect to superiors like his spiritual master, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and Vaiṣṇavas. There are many examples of how he should act. When Lord Kṛṣṇa was sitting on His throne and Nārada fortunately entered His assembly, even Lord Kṛṣṇa immediately stood up with His officers and ministers to offer respectful obeisances to Nārada. Nārada knew that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Kṛṣṇa knew that Nārada was His devotee, but although Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord and Nārada is the Lord’s devotee, the Lord observed the religious etiquette. Since Nārada was a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and an exalted devotee, even Kṛṣṇa, while acting as a king, offered His respectful obeisances unto Nārada. Such is the conduct visible in the Vedic civilization. A civilization in which the people do not know how the representative of Nārada and Kṛṣṇa should be respected, how society should be formed and how one should advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness—a society concerned only with manufacturing new cars and new skyscrapers every year and then breaking them to pieces and making new ones—may be technologically advanced, but it is not a human civilization. A human civilization is advanced when its people follow the <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇya</span> system, the system of four orders of life. There must be ideal, first-class men to act as advisors, second-class men to act as administrators, third-class men to produce food and protect cows, and fourth-class men who obey the three higher classes of society. One who does not follow the standard system of society should be considered a fifth-class man. A society without Vedic laws and regulations will not be very helpful to humanity. As stated in this verse, <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ te na paraṁ viduḥ:</span> such a society does not know the aim of life and the highest principle of religion.

            Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of destruction [as described in the previous verse] are, in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those who blindly follow them.

            We, the conditioned souls, have fallen in the ocean of nescience, but the human body fortunately provides us a good opportunity to cross the ocean because the human body is like a very good boat. When directed by a spiritual master acting as the captain, the boat can very easily cross the ocean. Furthermore, the boat is helped across by favorable winds, which are the instructions of Vedic knowledge. If one does not take advantage of all these facilities to cross the ocean of nescience, he is certainly committing suicide.
          </p>
          <p>
            One who boards a boat made of stone is doomed. To be elevated to the stage of perfection, humanity must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone. All of human society is in such a dangerous position that to be rescued it must abide by the standard instructions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The cream of these instructions appears in the form of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> One should not take shelter of any other instructions, for <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> gives direct instructions on how to fulfill the aim of human life. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa therefore says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</span> [Bg. 18.66] “Give up all other processes of religion and simply surrender to Me.” Even if one does not accept Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His instructions are so exalted and beneficial for humanity that if one follows His instructions one will be saved. Otherwise one will be cheated by unauthorized meditation and gymnastic methods of <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> Thus one will board a boat of stone. which will sink and drown all its passengers. Unfortunately. although the American people are extremely eager to get out of materialistic chaos, they are sometimes found to patronize the makers of stone boats. That will not help them. They must take the proper boat offered by Kṛṣṇa in the form of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Then they will be easily saved. In this regard Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments: <span class="Italic">aśmamayaḥ plavo yeṣāṁ te yathā majjantaṁ plavam anumajjanti tatheti rāja-nīty-upadeṣṭṛṣu sva-sabhyeṣu kopo vyañjitaḥ.</span> If society is guided by political diplomacy, with one nation maneuvering against another, it will certainly sink like a stone boat. political maneuvering and diplomacy will not save human society. People must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness to understand the aim of life, to understand God. and to fulfill the human mission.

            Lord Brahmā recognized the brahminical qualifications of Bṛhaspati, who was the spiritual master of the demigods because of his awareness of the Supreme Brahman. Bṛhaspati was very much in control of his senses and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Lord Brahmā chastised the demigods for not properly respecting this <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who was their <span class="Italic">guru.</span> Lord Brahmā wanted to impress upon the demigods that one’s <span class="Italic">guru</span> should not be disrespected under any circumstances. When Bṛhaspati entered the assembly of the demigods, they and their king, Indra, took him for granted. Since he came every day, they thought, they did not need to show him special respect. As it is said, familiarity breeds contempt. Being very much displeased, Bṛhaspati immediately left Indra’s palace. Thus all the demigods, headed by Indra, became offenders at the lotus feet of Bṛhaspati, and Lord Brahmā, being aware of this, condemned their neglect. In a song we sing every day, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, <span class="Italic">cakṣu-dāna dila yei, janme janme prabhu sei:</span> the <span class="Italic">guru</span> gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the <span class="Italic">guru</span> should be considered his master, life after life.

            The demigods continued: Do not fear criticism for being younger than us. Such etiquette does not apply in regard to Vedic mantras. Except in relationship to Vedic mantras, seniority is determined by age, but one may offer respectful obeisances even to a younger person who is advanced in chanting Vedic mantras. Therefore although you are junior in relationship to us, you may become our priest without hesitation.

            It is said, <span class="Italic">vṛddhatvaṁ vayasā vinā:</span> one may be senior without being advanced in age. Even if one is not old, one gains seniority if he is senior in knowledge. Viśvarūpa was junior in relationship to the demigods because he was their nephew, but the demigods wanted to accept him as their priest, and therefore he would have to accept obeisances from them. The demigods explained that this should not be a cause for hesitation; he could become their priest because he was advanced in Vedic knowledge. Similarly. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita advises, <span class="Italic">nīcād apy uttamaṁ jñānam:</span> one may accept education from a member of a lower social order. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> the members of the most elevated <span class="Italic">varṇa,</span> are teachers, but a person in a lower family, such as a family of <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas, vaiśyas</span> or even <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> may be accepted as a teacher if he has knowledge. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved of this when He expressed this opinion before Rāmānanda Rāya (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> 8.128):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            It does not matter whether one is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, śūdra, gṛhastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> These are all material designations. A spiritually advanced person has nothing to do with such designations. Therefore, if one is advanced in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, regardless of his position in human society, he may become a spiritual master.

            O exalted governors of various planets, the true brāhmaṇa, who has no material possessions, maintains himself by the profession of accepting śiloñchana. In other words, he picks up grains left in the field and on the ground in the wholesale marketplace. By this means, householder brāhmaṇas who actually abide by the principles of austerity and penance maintain themselves and their families and perform all necessary pious activities. A brāhmaṇa who desires to achieve happiness by gaining wealth through professional priesthood must certainly have a very low mind. How shall I accept such priesthood?

            A first-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> does not accept any rewards from his disciples or <span class="Italic">yajamānas.</span> Practicing austerities and penances, he instead goes to the agricultural field and collects food grains left by the agriculturalists to be collected by <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Similarly, such <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> go to marketplaces where grains are purchased and sold wholesale, and there they collect grains left by the merchants. In this way, such exalted <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> maintain their bodies and families. Such priests never demand anything from their disciples to live in opulence, imitating <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> or <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> In other words, a pure <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> voluntarily accepts a life of poverty and lives in complete dependence on the mercy of the Lord. Not very many years ago, a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> in Kṛṣṇanagara, near Navadvīpa, was offered some help from the local Zamindar, Vraja Kṛṣṇacandra. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> refused to accept the help. He said that since he was very happy in his householder life, taking rice given by his disciples and cooking vegetables of tamarind leaves, there was no question of taking help from the Zamindar. The conclusion is that although a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> may receive much opulence from his disciples, he should not utilize the rewards of his priesthood for his personal benefit; he must use them for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            The word <span class="Italic">samādhinā</span> is very important. <span class="Italic">Samādhi</span> means complete absorption with an undiverted mind. Viśvarūpa, who was a most learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> not only accepted the request of the demigods, but took their request seriously and performed the activities of priesthood with an undiverted mind. In other words, he accepted the priesthood not for material gain, but to profit the demigods. Such is the duty of a priest. The word <span class="Italic">puraḥ</span> means “family,” and <span class="Italic">hita</span> means “benefit.” Thus the word <span class="Italic">purohita</span> indicates that the priest is the well-wisher of the family. Another meaning of the word <span class="Italic">puraḥ</span> is “first.” A priest’s first duty is to see that his disciples benefit spiritually and materially by all means. Then he is satisfied. A priest should never be interested in performing Vedic rituals for his personal benefit.

            The opulence of the demons, who are generally known as the enemies of the demigods, was protected by the talents and tactics of Śukrācārya, but Viśvarūpa, who was most powerful, composed a protective prayer known as the Nārāyaṇa-kavaca. By this intelligent mantra, he took away the opulence of the demons and gave it to Mahendra, the King of heaven.

            The distinction between the demigods (<span class="Italic">devas</span>) and demons (<span class="Italic">asuras</span>) is that the demigods are all devotees of Lord Viṣṇu whereas the demons are devotees of demigods like Lord Śiva, Goddess Kālī and Goddess Durgā. Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahmā. For example, Hiraṇyakaśipu was a devotee of Lord Brahmā, Rāvaṇa was a devotee of Lord Śiva, and Mahiṣāsura was a devotee of Goddess Durgā. The demigods are devotees of Lord Viṣṇu (<span class="Italic">viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ smṛto daiva</span>), whereas the demons (<span class="Italic">āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ</span>) are always against the <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-bhaktas,</span> or Vaiṣṇavas. To oppose the Vaiṣṇavas, the demons become devotees of Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, Kālī, Durgā, and so on. In the days of yore, many long years ago, there was animosity between the <span class="Italic">devas</span> and the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> and the same spirit still continues, for the devotees of Lord Śiva and Goddess Durgā are always envious of Vaiṣṇavas, who are devotees of Lord Viṣṇu. This strain between the devotees of Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu has always existed. In the higher planetary systems, fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herein we see that Viśvarūpa made for the demigods a protective covering, saturated with a Viṣṇu <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Sometimes the Viṣṇu <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is called Viṣṇu-jvara, and the Śiva <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is called Śiva-jvara. We find in the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> that sometimes the Śiva-jvara and Viṣṇu-jvara are employed in the fights between the demons and the demigods.

            The word <span class="Italic">sura-dviṣām,</span> which in this verse means “of the enemies of the demigods,” also refers to the atheists. <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> elsewhere says that Lord Buddha appeared for the purpose of bewildering the demons or atheists. The Supreme Personality of Godhead always awards His benediction to devotees. The Lord Himself confirms this in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.31):
