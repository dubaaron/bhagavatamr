During the first day of the bright fortnight of the moon in the month of Agrahāyaṇa (November–December), every woman, following in the footsteps of Diti and following the instructions of her own husband, should begin this <span class="Italic">puṁsavana-vrata.</span> In the morning, after washing her teeth, bathing and thus becoming purified, she should hear about the birth mystery of the Maruts. Then, covering her body with a white dress and being properly ornamented, before breakfast she should worship Lord Viṣṇu and mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, Lord Viṣṇu’s wife, by glorifying Lord Viṣṇu for His mercy, patience, prowess, ability, greatness and other glories and for how He can bestow all mystic benedictions. While offering the Lord all paraphernalia for worship, such as ornaments, a sacred thread, scents, nice flowers, incense and water for bathing and washing His feet, hands and mouth, one should invite the Lord with this <span class="Italic">mantra:</span> <span class="Italic">oṁ namo bhagavate mahā-puruṣāya mahānubhāvāya mahāvibhūtipataye saha mahā-vibhūtibhir balim upaharāmi.</span> Then one should offer twelve oblations in the fire while chanting this <span class="Italic">mantra:</span> <span class="Italic">oṁ namo bhagavate mahā-puruṣāya mahāvibhūti-pataye svāhā.</span> One should offer obeisances while chanting this <span class="Italic">mantra</span> ten times.

Before beginning the worship of Lord Viṣṇu, the woman should hear the story of how the Maruts were born.

            “The personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance.” Therefore, to take shelter of the Supreme Lord is required. Whatever a devotee needs will be supplied by the complete Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham [Bg. </span>9.22]). Therefore a pure devotee will not ask anything from the Lord. He simply offers the Lord his respectful obeisances, and the Lord is prepared to accept whatever the devotee can secure to worship Him, even <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam</span>—a leaf, flower, fruit or water. There is no need to artificially exert oneself. It is better to be plain and simple and with respectful obeisances offer to the Lord whatever one can secure. The Lord is completely able to bless the devotee with all opulences.

            In this verse the words <span class="Italic">tato ’si bhagavān prabhuḥ</span> mean “Therefore You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of everyone.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all six opulences in full, and moreover He is extremely kind to His devotee. Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless wants all the living entities to surrender unto Him so that they may engage in His service. Thus He becomes satisfied. Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless becomes pleased when His devotee offers Him <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam</span>—a leaf, flower, fruit or water—in devotion. Sometimes the Lord, as the child of mother Yaśodā, requests His devotee for some food, as if He were very hungry. Sometimes He tells His devotee in a dream that His temple and His garden are now very old and that He cannot enjoy them very nicely. Thus He requests the devotee to repair them. Sometimes He is buried in the earth, and as if unable to come out Himself, He requests His devotee to rescue Him. Sometimes He requests His devotee to preach His glories all over the world, although He alone is quite competent to perform this task. Even though the Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all possessions and is self-sufficient, He depends on His devotees. Therefore the relationship of the Lord with His devotees is extremely confidential. Only the devotee can perceive how the Lord, although full in Himself, depends on His devotee for some particular work. This is explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (11.33), where the Lord tells Arjuna, <span class="Italic">nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin:</span> “O Arjuna, merely be an instrument in the fight.” Lord Kṛṣṇa had the competence to win the Battle of Kurukṣetra, but nonetheless He induced His devotee Arjuna to fight and become the cause of victory. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was quite competent enough to spread His name and mission all over the world, but still He depended upon His devotee to do this work. Considering all these points, the most important aspect of the Supreme Lord’s self-sufficiency is that He depends on His devotees. This is called His causeless mercy. The devotee who has perceived this causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by realization can understand the master and the servant.

            The Lord has multifarious potencies (<span class="Italic">parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate</span>).

It is said, <span class="Italic">śakti śaktimān abheda:</span> the power and the powerful are identical. Therefore mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is the constant companion of Lord Viṣṇu; they remain together constantly. One cannot keep Lakṣmī in one’s home without Lord Viṣṇu. To think that one can do so is very dangerous. To keep Lakṣmī, or the riches of the Lord, without the service of the Lord is always dangerous, for then Lakṣmī becomes the illusory energy. With Lord Viṣṇu, however, Lakṣmī is the spiritual energy.

However, because nondevotees do not realize that Lord Viṣṇu stays with His eternal consort, Lakṣmī, within the hearts of all living entities, they are not endowed with the opulence of Lord Viṣṇu. Unscrupulous men sometimes address a poor man as <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa,</span> or “poor Nārāyaṇa.” This is most unscientific. Lord Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī are always situated in everyone’s heart, but this does not mean that everyone is Nārāyaṇa, especially not those in poverty. This is a most abominable term to use in connection with Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa never becomes poor, and therefore He can never be called <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> Nārāyaṇa is certainly situated in everyone’s heart, but He is neither poor nor rich. Only unscrupulous persons who do not know the opulence of Nārāyaṇa try to afflict Him with poverty.

            Madhvācārya, the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of the Tattvavādīs, has described this verse in the following way: “Viṣṇu is described as <span class="Italic">yajña</span> personified, and mother Lakṣmī is described as spiritual activities and the original form of worship. In fact, they represent spiritual activities and the Supersoul of all <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> Lord Viṣṇu is the Supersoul even of Lakṣmīdevī, but no one can be the Supersoul of Lord Viṣṇu, for Lord Viṣṇu Himself is the spiritual Supersoul of everyone.”

            According to Madhvācārya, there are two <span class="Italic">tattvas,</span> or factors. One is independent, and the other is dependent. The first <span class="Italic">tattva</span> is the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, and the second is the <span class="Italic">jīva-tattva.</span> Lakṣmīdevī, being dependent on Lord Viṣṇu, is sometimes counted among the <span class="Italic">jīvas.</span> The Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, however, describe Lakṣmīdevī in accordance with the following two verses from the <span class="Italic">Prameya-ratnāvalī</span> of Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa. The first verse is a quotation from the <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa.</span>

As Lord Viṣṇu is all-pervading, His spiritual potency, mother Lakṣmī, is also all-pervading.” Lord Viṣṇu has three principal potencies—internal, external and marginal. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has accepted <span class="Italic">parā-śakti,</span> the spiritual energy of the Lord, as being identical with the Lord. Thus she is also included in the independent <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva.</span>”

            In the <span class="Italic">Kānti-mālā</span> commentary on the <span class="Italic">Prameya-ratnāvalī</span> there is this statement: <span class="Italic">nanu kvacit nitya-mukta jīvatvaṁ lakṣmyāḥ svīkṛtaṁ, tatrāha—prāheti.</span> <span class="Italic">nityaiveti padye sarva-vyāpti-kathanena kalākāṣṭhety ādi-padya-dvaye, śuddho ’pīty uktā ca mahāprabhunā svaśiṣyān prati lakṣmyā bhagavad-advaitam upadiṣṭam. kvacid yat tasyās tu dvaitam uktaṁ, tat tu tad-āviṣṭa-nitya-mukta jīvam ādāya saṅgatamas tu.</span> “Although some authoritative Vaiṣṇava disciplic successions count the goddess of fortune among the ever-liberated living entities (<span class="Italic">jīvas</span>) in Vaikuṇṭha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in accordance with the statement in the <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa,</span> has described Lakṣmī as being identical with the <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva.</span> The correct conclusion is that the descriptions of Lakṣmī as being different from Viṣṇu are stated when an eternally liberated living entity is imbued with the quality of Lakṣmī; they do not pertain to mother Lakṣmī, the eternal consort of Lord Viṣṇu.”

            One should accept this viṣṇu-vrata, which is a vow in devotional service, and should not deviate from its execution to engage in anything else.

Every day the wife must continue following the regulative principles to worship Lord Viṣṇu with great devotion. Thereafter, Lord Viṣṇu should be laid in His bed, and then one should take prasāda.

            If this vow or ritualistic ceremony is observed according to the description of śāstra, even in this life a man will be able to achieve all the benedictions he desires from the Lord.

            In Bengal even today if a woman lives for a long time with her husband, she is considered very fortunate. A woman generally desires a good husband, good children, a good home, prosperity, opulence and so on. As recommended in this verse, a woman will receive all these desirable benedictions, and a man will also be able to receive all benedictions, from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus by performing this particular type of <span class="Italic">vrata,</span> a man and a woman in Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be happy in this material world, and because of being Kṛṣṇa conscious they will be promoted to the spiritual world.

            If an unmarried girl observes this vrata, she will be able to get a very good husband. If a woman who is avīrā—who has no husband or son—executes this ritualistic ceremony, she can be promoted to the spiritual world. A woman whose children have died after birth can get a child with a long duration of life and also become very fortunate in possessing wealth. If a woman is unfortunate she will become fortunate, and if ugly she will become beautiful. By observing this vrata, a diseased man can gain relief from his disease and have an able body with which to work. If one recites this narration while offering oblations to the pitās and demigods, especially during the śrāddha ceremony, the demigods and inhabitants of Pitṛloka will be extremely pleased with him and bestow upon him the fulfillment of all desires. After one performs this ritualistic ceremony, Lord Viṣṇu and His wife, mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, are very pleased with him. O King Parīkṣit, now I have completely described how Diti performed this ceremony and had good children—the Maruts—and a happy life. I have tried to explain this to you as elaborately as possible.
