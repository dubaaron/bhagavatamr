          <div class="Normal-Level">In this Fourteenth Chapter, Parīkṣit Mahārāja asks his spiritual master, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, how such a demon as Vṛtrāsura could become an exalted devotee. In this connection the previous life of Vṛtrāsura is discussed. This involves the story of Citraketu and how he was victimized by lamentation because of the death of his son.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">Among many millions of living entities, the number of human beings is extremely small, and among human beings who are actually religious, only some are eager to be liberated from material existence. Among many thousands of people who desire relief from material existence, one is freed from the association of unwanted persons or is relieved of material contamination. And among many millions of such liberated persons, one may become a devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa. Therefore such devotees are extremely rare. Since <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> devotional service, is not ordinary, Parīkṣit Mahārāja was astonished that an <span class="Italic">asura</span> could rise to the exalted position of a devotee. Being doubtful, Parīkṣit Mahārāja inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who then described Vṛtrāsura with reference to his previous birth as Citraketu, the King of Śūrasena.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">Citraketu, who had no sons, got an opportunity to meet the great sage Aṅgirā. When Aṅgirā inquired from the King about his welfare, the King expressed his moroseness, and therefore by the grace of the great sage, the King’s first wife, Kṛtadyuti, gave birth to a son, who was the cause of both happiness and lamentation. Upon the birth of this son, the King and all the residents of the palace were very happy. The co-wives of Kṛtadyuti, however, were envious, and later they administered poison to the child. Citraketu was overwhelmed by shock at his son’s death. Then Nārada Muni and Aṅgirā went to see him.</div>

            King Parīkṣit inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī: O learned brāhmaṇa, demons are generally sinful, being obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance. How, then, could Vṛtrāsura have attained such exalted love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa?

            In this material world, everyone is obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance. However, unless one conquers these modes and comes to the platform of goodness, there is no chance of one’s becoming a pure devotee. This is confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.28):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          <p>
            “Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.” Since Vṛtrāsura was among the demons, Mahārāja Parīkṣit wondered how it was possible for him to have become such an exalted devotee.

Among many thousands who desire liberation, one may actually achieve liberation, giving up material attachment to society, friendship, love, country, home, wife and children.

            Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives the following purport to this verse. Simply desiring <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> or liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated. When one understands the futility of the materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> order, unattached to family, wife and children. One should then further progress to the platform of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life. Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated. Only rarely is someone liberated. Indeed, although many men take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> to become liberated, because of their imperfections they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="Italic">Jñānīs, yogīs</span> and <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> devoid of devotional service are called offenders. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">māyāvādī kṛṣṇe aparādhī:</span> one who thinks that everything is <span class="Italic">māyā</span> instead of thinking that everything is Kṛṣṇa is called an <span class="Italic">aparādhī,</span> or offender. Although the Māyāvādīs, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, they may nonetheless be counted among the <span class="Italic">siddhas,</span> those who have realized the self. They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life is. If such a person becomes <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa,</span> a devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa, he is better than a <span class="Italic">jīvan-mukta,</span> one who is liberated or perfect. This requires higher intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two kinds of <span class="Italic">jñānīs.</span> One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal realization. Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (<span class="Italic">sthūla-tuṣāvaghātinaḥ</span>). The other class of <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> whose <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is mixed with <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> are also of two kinds—those who are devoted to the so-called false form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha</span><i> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> the actual spiritual form. The Māyāvādī devotees worship Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu with the idea that Viṣṇu has accepted a form of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal. The pure devotee, however, never thinks that Viṣṇu has accepted a body of <span class="Italic">māyā;</span> instead, he knows perfectly well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. Such a devotee is actually situated in knowledge. He never merges in the Brahman effulgence. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (10.2.32):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">ye ’nye ’ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas<br>tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ<br>āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ<br>patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet.” Evidence of this same point is also given in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.11), wherein the Lord says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā<br>mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam<br>paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto<br>mama bhūta-maheśvaram<br><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.11]</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.” When rascals (<span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span>) see that Kṛṣṇa acts exactly like a human being, they deride the transcendental form of the Lord because they do not know the <span class="Italic">paraṁ bhāvam,</span> His transcendental form and activities. Such persons are further described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.12) as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo<br>mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ<br>rākṣasīm āsurīṁ caiva<br>prakṛtiṁ mohinīṁ śritāḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.” Such persons do not know that Kṛṣṇa’s body is not material. There is no distinction between Kṛṣṇa’s body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see Kṛṣṇa as a human being, they deride Him. They cannot imagine how a person like Kṛṣṇa could be the origin of everything (<span class="Italic">govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **</span>). Such persons are described as <span class="Italic">moghāśāḥ,</span> baffled in their hopes. Whatever they desire for the future will be baffled. Even if they apparently engage in devotional service, they are described as <span class="Italic">moghāśāḥ</span> because they ultimately desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who aspire to be elevated to the heavenly planets by devotional service will also be frustrated, because this is not the result of devotional service. However, they are also given a chance to engage in devotional service and be purified. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.2.17):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br>puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ<br>hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi<br>vidhunoti suhṛt satām</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramātmā [Supersoul] in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless the dirt within the core of one’s heart is cleansed away, one cannot become a pure devotee. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">sudurlabhaḥ</span> (“very rarely found”) is used in this verse. Not only among hundreds and thousands, but among millions of perfectly liberated souls, a pure devotee is hardly ever found. Therefore the words <span class="Italic">koṭiṣv api</span> are used herein. Śrīla Madhvācārya gives the following quotations from the <span class="Italic">Tantra Bhāgavata:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">nava-koṭyas tu devānām<br>ṛṣayaḥ sapta-koṭayaḥ<br>nārāyaṇāyanāḥ sarve<br>ye kecit tat-parāyaṇāḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “There are ninety million demigods and seventy million sages, who are all called <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇāyana,</span> devotees of Lord Nārāyaṇa. Among them, only a few are called <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa.</span>”

            “Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord. One should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong.” Kṛṣṇa, the supreme controller, has created the material world, which is completely perfect and free from scarcity. The Lord supplies the necessities of all living entities. These necessities come from the earth, and thus the earth is the source of supply. When there is a good ruler, that source produces the necessities of life abundantly. However, when there is not such a good ruler, there will be scarcity. This is the significance of the word <span class="Italic">kāmadhuk.</span> Elsewhere in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.10.4) it is said, <span class="Italic">kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ sarva-kāma-dughā mahī:</span> “During the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of men in profusion.” We have experience that in some seasons the rains produce abundance and in other seasons there is scarcity. We have no control over the earth’s productiveness, for it is naturally under the full control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His order, the Lord can make the earth produce sufficiently or insufficiently. If a pious king rules the earth according to the śāstric injunctions, there will naturally be regular rainfall and sufficient produce to provide for all men. There will be no question of exploitation, for everyone will have enough. Black-marketeering and other corrupt dealings will then automatically stop. Simply ruling the land cannot solve man’s problems unless the leader has spiritual capabilities. He must be like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Parīkṣit Mahārāja or Rāmacandra. Then all the inhabitants of the land will be extremely happy.

In spite of the material assets of <span class="Italic">janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī</span>—birth in an aristocratic family with full opulence, wealth, education and beauty—he was very much aggrieved because in spite of having so many wives, he had no son.

            The great sage Aṅgirā said: My dear King, I hope that your body and mind and your royal associates and paraphernalia are well. When the seven properties of material nature [the total material energy, the ego and the five objects of sense gratification] are in proper order, the living entity within the material elements is happy. Without these seven elements one cannot exist. Similarly, a king is always protected by seven elements—his instructor (svāmī or guru), his ministers, his kingdom, his fort, his treasury, his royal order and his friends.

            A king is not alone. He first has his spiritual master, the supreme guide. Then come his ministers, his kingdom, his fortifications, his treasury, his system of law and order, and his friends or allies. If these seven are properly maintained, the king is happy. Similarly, as explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (<span class="Italic">dehino ’smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span>), the living entity, the soul, is within the material covering of the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> ego and <span class="Italic">pañca-tanmātrā,</span> the five objects of sense gratification. When these seven are in proper order, the living entity is in a mood of pleasure. Generally when the associates of the king are quiet and obedient, the king can be happy. Therefore the great sage Aṅgirā Ṛṣi inquired about the King’s personal health and the good fortune of his seven associates. When we inquire from a friend whether everything is well, we are concerned not only with his personal self but also with his family, his source of income, and his assistants or servants. All of them must be well, and then a person can be happy.

            In response to the request of Mahārāja Citraketu, Aṅgirā Ṛṣi, who was born of Lord Brahmā’s mind, was very merciful toward him. Because the sage was a greatly powerful personality, he performed a sacrifice by offering oblations of sweetrice to Tvaṣṭā.

            Thereafter, the great sage told the King, “O great King, now you will have a son who will be the cause of both jubilation and lamentation.” The sage then left, without waiting for Citraketu’s response.

            The word <span class="Italic">harṣa</span> means “jubilation,” and <span class="Italic">śoka</span> means “lamentation.” The King was overwhelmed with joy when he understood that he would have a son. Because of his great jubilation, he could not actually understand the statement of the sage Aṅgirā. He accepted it to mean that there would certainly be jubilation because of the birth of his future son, but that he would be the King’s only son and, being very proud of his great wealth and empire, would not be very obedient to his father. Thus the King was satisfied, thinking, “Let there be a son. It does not matter if he is not very obedient.” In Bengal there is a proverb that instead of having no maternal uncle, it is better to have a maternal uncle who is blind. The King accepted this philosophy, thinking that a disobedient son would be better than no son at all. The great sage Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says:
          </p>

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “What is the use of a son who is neither a learned scholar nor a devotee? Such a son is like a blind, diseased eye, which always causes suffering.” Nevertheless, the material world is so polluted that one wants to have a son even though he is useless. This attitude was represented in the history of King Citraketu.

            My Lord, You may say that there is no law that a father must die in the lifetime of his son and that a son must be born in the lifetime of his father, since everyone lives and dies according to his own fruitive activity. However, if fruitive activity is so strong that birth and death depend upon it, there is no need of a controller, or God. Again, if You say that a controller is needed because the material energy does not have the power to act, one may answer that if the bonds of affection You have created are disturbed by fruitive action, no one will raise children with affection; instead, everyone will cruelly neglect his children. Since You have cut the bonds of affection that compel a parent to raise his child, You appear inexperienced and unintelligent.

            My dear son, I am helpless and very much aggrieved. You should not give up my company. Just look at your lamenting father. We are helpless because without a son we shall have to suffer the distress of going to the darkest hellish regions. You are the only hope by which we can get out of these dark regions. Therefore I request you not to go any further with the merciless Yama.

            According to the Vedic injunctions, one must accept a wife just to beget a son who can deliver one from the clutches of Yamarāja. Unless one has a son to offer oblations to the <span class="Italic">pitās,</span> or forefathers, one must suffer in Yamarāja’s kingdom. King Citraketu was very much aggrieved. thinking that because his son was going away with Yamarāja he himself would again suffer. The subtle laws exist for the <span class="Italic">karmīs;</span> if one becomes a devotee, he has no more obligations to the laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span>

            My dear son, you have slept a long time. Now please get up. Your playmates are calling you to play. Since you must be very hungry, please get up and suck my breast and dissipate our lamentation.

            My dear son, I am certainly most unfortunate, for I can no longer see your mild smiling. You have closed your eyes forever. I therefore conclude that you have been taken from this planet to another, from which you will not return. My dear son, I can no longer hear your pleasing voice.
