<A NAME="78016"></A><div id="78016"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">This chapter relates how all the sons of Dak&#7779;a were delivered from the clutches of the material energy by following the advice of N&#257;rada, who was therefore cursed by Dak&#7779;a.</div>
</div><A NAME="78017"></A><div id="78017"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Influenced by the external energy of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a begot ten thousand sons in the womb of his wife, P&#257;&#241;cajan&#299;. These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the Harya&#347;vas. Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Harya&#347;vas went west to the place where the River Sindhu (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea. In those days this was the site of a holy lake named N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a-saras, where there were many saintly persons. The Harya&#347;vas began practicing austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of life. However, when &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada Muni saw these boys engaged in such commendable austerities simply for material creation, he thought it better to release them from this tendency. N&#257;rada Muni described to the boys their ultimate goal of life and advised them not to become ordinary <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> to beget children. Thus all the sons of Dak&#7779;a became enlightened and left, never to return.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, who was very sad at the loss of his sons, begot one thousand more sons in the womb of his wife, P&#257;&#241;cajan&#299;, and ordered them to increase progeny. These sons, who were named the Saval&#257;&#347;vas, also engaged in worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to beget children, but N&#257;rada Muni convinced them to become mendicants and not beget children. Foiled twice in his attempts to increase population, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a became most angry at N&#257;rada Muni and cursed him, saying that in the future he would not be able to stay anywhere. Since N&#257;rada Muni, being fully qualified, was fixed in tolerance, he accepted Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s curse.</div>

Through this analogy, N&#257;rada Muni asked them to consider why they should follow their father&rsquo;s order to be entangled in family life. Indirectly, he asked them to find within the cores of their hearts the situation of the Supersoul, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, for then they would truly be experienced. In other words, one who is too involved in his material environment and does not look within the core of his heart is increasingly entangled in the illusory energy. N&#257;rada Muni&rsquo;s purpose was to get the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a to divert their attention toward spiritual realization instead of involving themselves in the ordinary but complicated affairs of propagation. The same advice was given by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to his father (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/5?d=1">7.5.5</a>):</div>

N&#257;rada Muni advised the Harya&#347;vas not to enter household life. Since they were already advanced in spiritual knowledge, why should they be entangled in that way?</div>

<div class="First">N&#257;rada Muni spoke to the Harya&#347;vas, the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, about ten allegorical subjects&mdash;the king, the kingdom, the river, the house, the physical elements and so forth. After considering these by themselves, the Harya&#347;vas could understand that the living entity encaged in his body seeks happiness, but takes no interest in how to become free from his encagement. This is a very important verse, since all the living entities in the material world are very active, having obtained their particular types of bodies. A man works all day and night for sense gratification, and animals like hogs and dogs also work for sense gratification all day and night. Birds, beasts and all other conditioned living entities engage in various activities without knowledge of the soul encaged within the body. Especially in the human form of body, one&rsquo;s duty is to act in such a way that he can release himself from his encagement, but without the instructions of N&#257;rada or his representative in the disciplic succession, people blindly engage in bodily activities to enjoy <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-sukha</span>&mdash;flickering, temporary happiness. They do not know how to become free from their material encagement. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva therefore said that such activity is not at all good, since it encages the soul again and again in a body subjected to the threefold miseries of the material condition.</div>

<div class="First">A woman who has no husband declares herself independent, which means that she becomes a prostitute. A prostitute generally dresses herself in various fashions intended to attract a man&rsquo;s attention to the lower part of her body. Today it has become a much advertised fashion for a woman to go almost naked, covering the lower part of her body only slightly, in order to draw the attention of a man to her private parts for sexual enjoyment. The intelligence engaged to attract a man to the lower part of the body is the intelligence of a professional prostitute. Similarly, the intelligence of a living entity who does not turn his attention toward K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement simply changes dresses like a prostitute. What is the benefit of such foolish intelligence? One should be intelligently conscious in such a way that he need no longer change from one body to another.</div>

<div class="First">The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is very eager to present Vedic literature in modern languages, especially Western languages such as English, French and German. The leaders of the Western world, the Americans and Europeans, have become the idols of modern civilization because the Western people are very sophisticated in temporary activities for the advancement of material civilization. A sane man, however, can see that all such grand activities, although perhaps very important for temporary life, have nothing to do with eternal life. The entire world is imitating the materialistic civilization of the West, and therefore the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is very much interested in giving the Western people knowledge by translating the original Sanskrit Vedic literatures into Western languages.</div>

The people of the West are seeing their students becoming hippies, despite gorgeous arrangements for university education.

Living like an animal, not understanding the goal of life, one foolishly thinks that there is no eternity and that his life span of fifty, sixty, or, at the most, one hundred years, is everything. This is the greatest foolishness. Time is eternal, and in the material world one passes through different phases of his eternal life. Time is compared herein to a sharp razor. A razor is meant to shave the hair from one&rsquo;s face, but if not carefully handled, the razor will cause disaster. One is advised not to create a disaster by misusing his lifetime.

<div class="Purport">In regard to the instructions of the father and mother, it may be said that every living entity, including even the insignificant cats, dogs and serpents, takes birth of a father and mother. Therefore, getting a material father and mother is not a problem. In every form of life, birth after birth, the living entity gets a father and mother. In human society, however, if one is satisfied with his material father and mother and their instructions and does not make further progress by accepting a spiritual master and being educated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> he certainly remains in darkness. The material father and mother are important only if they are interested in educating their son to become free from the clutches of death. As instructed by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/5/18?d=1">5.5.18</a>): <span class="Italic">pit&#257; na sa sy&#257;j janan&#299; na s&#257; sy&#257;t/ na mocayed ya&#7717; samupeta-m&#7771;tyum.</span> One should not strive to become a mother or father if one cannot save one&rsquo;s dependent son from the impending danger of death. A parent who does not know how to save his son has no value because such fathers and mothers may be had in any form of life, even among the cats, dogs and so on. Only a father and mother who can elevate their son to the spiritual platform are bona fide parents. Therefore according to the Vedic system it is said, <span class="Italic">janman&#257; j&#257;yate &#347;&#363;dra&#7717;:</span> one is born of a material father and mother as a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> The purpose of life, however, is to become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> a first-class man.</div>

This would have been unnecessarily entangling. The Harya&#347;vas did not consider pious and impious activities.

<div class="Translation">The seven musical notes&mdash;&#7779;a, &#7771;, g&#257;, ma, pa, dha and ni&mdash;are used in musical instruments, but originally they come from the S&#257;ma Veda. The great sage N&#257;rada vibrates sounds describing the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. By such transcendental vibrations, such as Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare, he fixes his mind at the lotus feet of the Lord.

<div class="After-Verse">The purport of this song is that N&#257;rada Muni, the great soul, plays a stringed instrument called a <span class="Italic">v&#299;&#7751;&#257;,</span> vibrating the sound <span class="Italic">r&#257;dhik&#257;-rama&#7751;a,</span> which is another name for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As soon as he strokes the strings, all the devotees begin responding, making a very beautiful vibration. Accompanied by the stringed instrument, the singing seems like a shower of nectar, and all the devotees dance in ecstasy to the fullest extent of their satisfaction. While dancing, they appear madly intoxicated with ecstasy, as if drinking the beverage called <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhur&#299;-p&#363;ra.</span> Some of them cry, some of them dance, and some of them, although unable to dance publicly, dance within their hearts. Lord &#346;iva embraces N&#257;rada Muni and begins talking in an ecstatic voice, and seeing Lord &#346;iva dancing with N&#257;rada, Lord Brahm&#257; also joins, saying, &ldquo;All of you kindly chant &lsquo;Hari bol! Hari bol!&rsquo; &rdquo; The King of heaven, Indra, also gradually joins with great satisfaction and begins dancing and chanting &ldquo;Hari bol! Hari bol!&rdquo; In this way, by the influence of the transcendental vibration of the holy name of God, the whole universe becomes ecstatic. Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura says, &ldquo;When the universe becomes ecstatic, my desire is satisfied. I therefore pray unto the lotus feet of R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; that this chanting of <span class="Italic">harer n&#257;ma</span></I> [Adi </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/adi/17/21?d=1">17.21</a></I>]</I> may go on nicely like this.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">The Harya&#347;vas, the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, were very well behaved, cultured sons, but unfortunately, because of the instructions of N&#257;rada Muni, they deviated from the order of their father. When Dak&#7779;a heard this news, which was brought to him by N&#257;rada Muni, he began to lament. Although he was the father of such good sons, he had lost them all. Certainly this was lamentable.</div>

<div class="First">The Harya&#347;vas, the sons of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, were certainly well behaved, learned and advanced, and in accordance with the order of their father they went to perform austerities to beget good sons for their family. But N&#257;rada Muni took advantage of their good behavior and culture to properly direct them not to be involved with this material world, but to use their culture and knowledge to end their material affairs. The Harya&#347;vas abided by the order of N&#257;rada Muni, but when news of this was brought to Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;pati,</span> instead of being happy with the actions of N&#257;rada Muni, was extremely sorrowful. Similarly, we are trying to bring as many young men as possible to the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement for their ultimate benefit, but the parents of the young men joining this movement, being very sorry, are lamenting and making counterpropaganda. Of course, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a did not make propaganda against N&#257;rada Muni, but later, as we shall see, Dak&#7779;a cursed N&#257;rada Muni for his benevolent activities. This is the way of materialistic life. A materialistic father and mother want to engage their sons in begetting children, striving for improved economic conditions and rotting in materialistic life. They are not unhappy when their children become spoiled, useless citizens, but they lament when they join the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement to achieve the ultimate goal of life. This animosity between parents and the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has existed since time immemorial. Even N&#257;rada Muni was condemned, not to speak of others. Nevertheless, N&#257;rada Muni never gives up his mission. To deliver as many fallen souls as possible, he continues playing his musical instrument and vibrating the transcendental sound Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare.</div>

As a dutiful father, he did not hesitate to allow his sons to receive cultural instructions concerning the perfection of life; he depended upon them to choose whether to return home, back to Godhead, or to rot in this material world in various species of life. In all circumstances, the duty of the father is to give cultural education to his sons, who must later decide which way to go. Responsible fathers should not hinder their sons who are making cultural advancement in association with the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. This is not a father&rsquo;s duty.

<div class="First">From these verses it is apparent that the chanting of the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> or the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> must be accompanied by severe austerities. In Kali-yuga, people cannot undergo severe austerities like those mentioned herein&mdash;drinking only water and eating only air for many months. One cannot imitate such a process. But at least one must undergo some austerity by giving up four unwanted principles, namely illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Anyone can easily practice this <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> and then the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> will be effective without delay. One should not give up the process of austerity. If possible, one should bathe in the waters of the Ganges or Yamun&#257;, or in the absence of the Ganges and Yamun&#257; one may bathe in the water of the sea. This is an item of austerity. Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has therefore established two very large centers, one in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and another in M&#257;y&#257;pur, Navadv&#299;pa. There one may bathe in the Ganges or Yamun&#257;, chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and thus become perfect and return home, back to Godhead.</div>

This is the duty of N&#257;rada Muni and his followers. They must show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead. Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, however, could not see the exaltedness of the duties N&#257;rada Muni performed in relation to his sons.

<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">bhik&#7779;or m&#257;rga,</span> &ldquo;the path of the renounced order,&rdquo; are very significant in this regard. A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is called <span class="Italic">trida&#7751;&#7693;i-bhik&#7779;u</span> because his duty is to beg alms from the homes of <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> and to give the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> spiritual instructions. A <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is allowed to beg from door to door, but a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> cannot do so. <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hasthas</span> may earn their living according to the four divisions of spiritual life. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a g&#7771;hastha</span> may earn his livelihood by becoming a learned scholar and teaching people in general how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He may also assume the duty of worship himself. Therefore it is said that only <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> may engage in Deity worship, and they may accept as <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> whatever people offer the Deity. Although a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal maintenance but for the worship of the Deity. Thus a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> does not stock anything for his future use. Similarly, <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> may collect taxes from the citizens, and they must also protect the citizens, enforce rules and regulations, and maintain law and order. <span class="Italic">Vai&#347;yas</span> should earn their livelihood through agriculture and cow protection, and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> should maintain their livelihood by serving the three higher classes. Unless one becomes a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> one cannot take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa.</span> <span class="Italic">Sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s</span> may beg alms door to door, but a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> cannot.</div>

According to Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s opinion, N&#257;rada Muni had misled Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s inexperienced sons (<span class="Italic">as&#257;dhv ak&#257;ry arbhak&#257;&#7751;&#257;m</span>). Dak&#7779;a regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when N&#257;rada showed them the renounced order of life. Because of all these considerations, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a charged that N&#257;rada Muni was <span class="Italic">as&#257;dhu</span> and should not have adopted the dress of a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu.</span></div>
<A NAME="78521"></A><div id="78521"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas,</span> especially when he instructs their young sons to accept K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Generally a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> thinks that unless one enters <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life he cannot properly enter the renounced order. If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced order in accordance with the instructions of N&#257;rada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents become very angry. This same phenomenon is occurring in our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement because we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation. We allow <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life, but a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> also follows the path of renunciation. Even a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> has to give up so many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed. We allow no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so many no&rsquo;s, one&rsquo;s life can be positive. In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population. Therefore parents sometimes dislike our movement, just as Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a disliked the activities of N&#257;rada and accused N&#257;rada of dishonesty. Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because we are in the disciplic succession from N&#257;rada Muni.</div>

<div class="Purport">People addicted to householder life wonder how one can give up the enjoyment of <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> life, which is a concession for sex enjoyment, simply to become a mendicant in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. They do not know that the householder&rsquo;s concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a mendicant. The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one&rsquo;s fiftieth year one must give up household life. This is compulsory. However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering. In such cases, the disciples of N&#257;rada Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement immediately. There is nothing wrong in this.</div>

<div class="First">This mentality of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a still continues even today. When young boys join the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s,</span> fruitive workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life. A <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> however, especially a <span class="Italic">bhakti-yog&#299;,</span> is callous to the opinions of this material world. He is not interested in traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic civilization.

A pure devotee is not interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman. He is interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead. Since Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a was a <span class="Italic">karm&#299;,</span> he could not appreciate the great service N&#257;rada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons. Instead, he accused N&#257;rada Muni of being sinful and charged that because N&#257;rada Muni was associated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed. Thus Dak&#7779;a criticized that N&#257;rada Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Such are the criticisms that must be borne by the servants of N&#257;rada Muni in the disciplic succession. Through the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, we are trying to train young people to become devotees and return home, back to Godhead, by following rigid regulative principles, but our service is appreciated neither in India nor abroad in the Western countries where we are endeavoring to spread this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. In India the caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> have become enemies of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement because we elevate foreigners, who are supposed to be <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas,</span> to the position of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> We train them in austerities and penances and recognize them as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> by awarding them sacred threads. Thus the caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> of India are very displeased by our activities in the Western world. In the West also, the parents of the young people who join this movement have also become enemies. We have no business creating enemies, but the process is such that nondevotees will always be inimical toward us. Nevertheless, as stated in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> a devotee should be both tolerant and merciful. Devotees engaged in preaching should be prepared to be accused by ignorant persons, and yet they must be very merciful to the fallen conditioned souls. If one can execute his duty in the disciplic succession of N&#257;rada Muni, his service will surely be recognized. As the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/68?d=1">18.68</a>&ndash;69):</div>

According to Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s philosophy. one should become implicated in material enjoyment so that after experiencing the distress of such enjoyment. one will automatically renounce.

<div class="First">Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a wanted to prove that he had been most tolerant in not having said anything when N&#257;rada Muni, for no reason, induced his ten thousand innocent sons to adopt the path of renunciation. Sometimes householders are accused of being <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;s,</span> for <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;s</span> are satisfied with family life without spiritual advancement. <span class="Italic">G&#7771;hasthas,</span> however, are different because although <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas</span> live in householder life with their wives and children, they are eager for spiritual advancement. Wanting to prove that he had been magnanimous to N&#257;rada Muni, Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a stressed that when N&#257;rada had misled his first sons, Dak&#7779;a had taken no action; he had been kind and tolerant. He was aggrieved, however, because N&#257;rada Muni had misled his sons for a second time. Therefore he wanted to prove that N&#257;rada Muni, although dressed like a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu,</span> was not actually a <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu;</span> he himself, although a householder, was a greater <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> than N&#257;rada Muni.</div>

<div class="First">Because Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a was a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;</span> who wanted to remain in household life, he thought that if N&#257;rada Muni could not remain in one place, but had to travel all over the world, that would be a great punishment for him. Actually, however, such a punishment is a boon for a preacher. A preacher is known as <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya</span>&mdash;an <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> or teacher, who always travels for the benefit of human society. Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a cursed N&#257;rada Muni by saying that although he had the facility to travel all over the universe, he would never be able to stay in one place. In the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system from N&#257;rada Muni, I have also been cursed. Although I have many centers that would be suitable places of residence, I cannot stay anywhere, for I have been cursed by the parents of my young disciples. Since the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement was started, I have traveled all over the world two or three times a year, and although I am provided comfortable places to stay wherever I go, I cannot stay anywhere for more than three days or a week. I do not mind this curse by the parents of my disciples, but now it is necessary that I stay in one place to finish another task&mdash;this translation of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> If my young disciples, especially those who have taken <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> take charge of traveling all over the world, it may be possible for me to transfer the curse of the parents to these young preachers. Then I may sit down conveniently in one place for the work of translation.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.&rdquo; Following the orders of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, one who preaches the glories of the Lord all over the world or all over the universe should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree because a preacher cannot live an easygoing life. Indeed, a preacher must face many impediments. Not only is he sometimes cursed, but sometimes he must also suffer personal injury. For example, when Nity&#257;nanda Prabhu went to preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness to the two roguish brothers Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i, they injured Him and made His head bleed, but nevertheless, He tolerantly delivered the two rogues, who became perfect Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. This is the duty of a preacher. Lord Jesus Christ even tolerated crucifixion. Therefore the curse against N&#257;rada was not very astonishing, and he tolerated it.</div>
<A NAME="78648"></A><div id="78648"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Now, it may be asked why N&#257;rada Muni stayed in the presence of Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a and tolerated all his accusations and curses. Was that for Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s deliverance? The answer is yes. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that after being insulted by Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a, N&#257;rada Muni should have left immediately, but he purposely stayed to hear all Dak&#7779;a&rsquo;s strong words so that Dak&#7779;a might be relieved of his anger. Praj&#257;pati Dak&#7779;a was not an ordinary man; he had accumulated the results of many pious activities. Therefore N&#257;rada Muni expected that after delivering his curse, Dak&#7779;a, satisfied and freed from anger, would repent his misbehavior and thus get a chance to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and be delivered. When Jag&#257;i and M&#257;dh&#257;i offended Lord Nity&#257;nanda, Lord Nity&#257;nanda stood tolerantly, and therefore both brothers fell at His lotus feet and repented. Consequently they later became perfect Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas.</div>
