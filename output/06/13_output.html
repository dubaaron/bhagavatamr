          <div class="Normal-Level">This chapter describes Indra’s fear at having killed a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> (Vṛtrāsura), and it also describes how he fled and was saved by the grace of Lord Viṣṇu.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">When all the demigods requested Indra to kill Vṛtrāsura, he refused because Vṛtrāsura was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> The demigods, however, encouraged Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the Nārāyaṇa-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Nārāyaṇa. Even by a glimpse of the chanting of Nārāyaṇa’s name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> The demigods advised Indra to perform an <span class="Italic">aśvamedha</span> sacrifice, by which Nārāyaṇa would be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire universe.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="Normal-Level">Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought Vṛtrāsura, but when Vṛtrāsura was killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew Vṛtrāsura’s position. This is the nature of a great personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally. Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins. He went to Mānasa-sarovara, and there, under the protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years. During this time, Nahuṣa reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by the beauty of Indra’s wife, Śacīdevī, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life. Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and saints. In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>

            Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the other demigods returned to their respective abodes, but Indra did not, for he was disturbed at having killed Vṛtrāsura, who was actually a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> After killing Vṛtrāsura, Indra went to the Mānasa-sarovara Lake to become free from sinful reactions. When he left the lake, he performed an <span class="Italic">aśvamedha-yajña</span> and then returned to his own abode.

            Mahārāja Parīkṣit inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī: O great sage, what was the reason for Indra’s unhappiness? I wish to hear about this. When he killed Vṛtrāsura, all the demigods were extremely happy. Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_3_purport">
          <p>
            This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are happy. In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of Vṛtrāsura’s having been killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he had killed a great devotee and <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Vṛtrāsura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a great devotee and therefore a great <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahlāda Mahārāja and Bali Mahārāja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while fighting with Indra, Vṛtrāsura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, Vṛtrāsura was transferred to Vaikuṇṭhaloka to become an associate of Saṅkarṣaṇa. Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaiṣṇava or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A Vaiṣṇava is already a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> although a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> may not be a Vaiṣṇava. The <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa</span> says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            One may be a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> in terms of his culture and family and may be expert in Vedic knowledge (<span class="Italic">mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ</span>), but if he is not a Vaiṣṇava, he cannot be a <span class="Italic">guru.</span> This means that an expert <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> may not be a Vaiṣṇava, but a Vaiṣṇava is already a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> A millionaire may very easily possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not necessarily a millionaire. Vṛtrāsura was a perfect Vaiṣṇava, and therefore he was also a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>

            Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī answered: When all the great sages and demigods were disturbed by the extraordinary power of Vṛtrāsura, they had assembled to ask Indra to kill him. Indra, however, being afraid of killing a brāhmaṇa, declined their request.

            King Indra replied: When I killed Viśvarūpa, I received extensive sinful reactions, but I was favored by the women, land, trees and water, and therefore I was able to divide the sin among them.

Other sinful persons, such as dog-eaters and caṇḍālas, who are less than śūdras, can also be freed in this way. But you are a devotee, and we shall help you by performing the great horse sacrifice.

            Also, in the <i>P<span class="Italic"></span></i>rema-vivarta by Jagadānanda Paṇḍita it is said:

          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          <p>
            This means that by once chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can be freed from the reactions of more sins that he can even imagine performing. The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities. What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy name. Such a mentality is a most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. <span class="Italic">Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ:</span> the Lord’s holy name certainly has the potency to neutralize all sinful activities, but if one repeatedly and intentionally commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most condemned.
          </p>
          <p>
            These verses name the performers of various sinful deeds. In the <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> the following names are given. A son begotten by a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and born from the womb of a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> mother is called a <span class="Italic">pāraśava</span> or <span class="Italic">niṣāda,</span> a hunter accustomed to stealing. A son begotten by a <span class="Italic">niṣāda</span> in the womb of a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> woman is called a <span class="Italic">pukkasa.</span> A child begotten by a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> in the womb of the daughter of a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is called an <span class="Italic">ugra.</span> A child begotten by a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> in the womb of the daughter of a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> is called a <span class="Italic">kṣattā.</span> A child begotten by a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> in the womb of a lower-class woman is called a <span class="Italic">śvāda,</span> or dog-eater. All such offspring are considered extremely sinful, but the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so strong that all of them can be purified simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement offers everyone a chance to be purified, regardless of birth or family. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (2.4.18):

            “Kirātas, Hūṇas, Āndhras, Pulindas, Pulkaśas, Ābhīras, Śumbhas, Yavanas, members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.” Even such sinful persons can certainly all be purified if they chant the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee.

            Herein the sages encourage King Indra to kill Vṛtrāsura even at the risk of <span class="Italic">brahma-hatyā,</span> the killing of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and they guarantee to release him from sinful reactions by performing an <span class="Italic">aśvamedha-yajña.</span> Such purposefully devised atonement, however, cannot relieve the performer of sinful acts. This will be seen from the following verse.

            Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Encouraged by the words of the sages, Indra killed Vṛtrāsura, and when he was killed the sinful reaction for killing a brāhmaṇa [brahma-hatyā] certainly took shelter of Indra.

            After killing Vṛtrāsura, Indra could not surpass the <span class="Italic">brahma-hatyā,</span> the sinful reactions for killing a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Formerly he had killed one <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> Viśvarūpa, out of circumstantial anger, but this time, following the advice of the sages, he killed another <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> purposely. Therefore the sinful reaction was greater than before. Indra could not be relieved from the reaction simply by performing sacrifices for atonement. He had to undergo a severe series of sinful reactions, and when he was freed by such suffering, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> allowed him to perform the horse sacrifice. The planned execution of sinful deeds on the strength of chanting the holy name of the Lord or undergoing <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta,</span> atonement, cannot give relief to anyone, even to Indra or Nahuṣa. Nahuṣa was officiating for Indra while Indra, absent from heaven, was going here and there to gain release from his sinful reactions.

            Following the advice of the demigods, Indra killed Vṛtrāsura, and he suffered because of this sinful killing. Although the other demigods were happy, he could not derive happiness from the killing of Vṛtrāsura. Indra’s other good qualities, such as tolerance and opulence, could not help him in his grief.

            One cannot be happy by committing sinful acts, even if one is endowed with material opulence. Indra found this to be true. People began to blaspheme him, saying, “This person has killed a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> for the sake of enjoying heavenly material happiness.” Therefore in spite of being King of heaven and enjoying material opulence, Indra was always unhappy because of the accusations of the populace.

            Indra saw personified sinful reaction chasing him, appearing like a caṇḍāla woman, a woman of the lowest class. She seemed very old, and all the limbs of her body trembled.

            Always thinking of how he could be relieved from the sinful reaction for killing a brāhmaṇa, King Indra, invisible to everyone, lived in the lake for one thousand years in the subtle fibers of the stem of a lotus. The fire-god used to bring him his share of all yajñas, but because the fire-god was afraid to enter the water, Indra was practically starving.

            As long as King Indra lived in the water, wrapped in the stem of the lotus, Nahuṣa was equipped with the ability to rule the heavenly kingdom, due to his knowledge, austerity and mystic power. Nahuṣa, however, blinded and maddened by power and opulence, made undesirable proposals to Indra’s wife with a desire to enjoy her. Thus Nahuṣa was cursed by a brāhmaṇa and later became a snake.

            Indra’s sins were diminished by the influence of Rudra, the demigod of all directions. Because Indra was protected by the goddess of fortune, Lord Viṣṇu’s wife, who resides in the lotus clusters of Mānasa-sarovara Lake, Indra’s sins could not affect him. Indra was ultimately relieved of all the reactions of his sinful deeds by strictly worshiping Lord Viṣṇu. Then he was called back to the heavenly planets by the brāhmaṇas and reinstated in his position.
