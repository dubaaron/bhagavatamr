<div class="Translation">Vidura inquired from Maitreya: O br&#257;hma&#7751;a, you formerly spoke about the sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi and informed me that they satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead by chanting a song composed by Lord &#346;iva. What did they achieve in this way?</div>

<div class="First">In the beginning, Maitreya &#7770;&#7779;i narrated the activities of the sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi. These sons went beside a great lake, which was like an ocean, and fortunately finding Lord &#346;iva, they learned how to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by chanting the songs composed by Lord &#346;iva. Now their father&rsquo;s attachment for fruitive activities was disapproved by N&#257;rada, who therefore kindly instructed Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi by telling him the allegorical story of Puraï¿½jana. Now Vidura again wanted to hear about Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&rsquo;s sons, and he was especially inquisitive to know what they achieved by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here the words <span class="Italic">siddhim &#257;pu&#7717;,</span> or &ldquo;achieved perfection,&rdquo; are very important. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/3?d=1">7.3</a>), <span class="Italic">manu&#7779;y&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; sahasre&#7779;u ka&#347;cid yatati siddhaye:</span> out of many, many millions of people, one may be interested in learning how to attain success in spiritual matters. The supreme success is mentioned also in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/8/15?d=1">8.15</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;After attaining Me, the great souls, who are <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.&rdquo; And what is that highest perfection? That is also explained in that verse. The highest perfection is to return home, back to Godhead, so that one will not have to return to this material world and transmigrate from one body to another in the dream of material existence. By the grace of Lord &#346;iva, the Pracet&#257;s actually attained perfection and returned home, back to Godhead, after enjoying material facilities to the highest extent. Maitreya will now narrate that to Vidura.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear B&#257;rhaspatya, what did the sons of King Barhi&#7779;at, known as the Pracet&#257;s, obtain after meeting Lord &#346;iva, who is very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the bestower of liberation?

<div class="First">All types of material happiness are obtained in this life or in the next life, on this planet or on another. The living entity wanders within this material universe in so many species of life and so many planetary systems. The distress and happiness obtained during the span of life are called <span class="Italic">iha,</span> and the distress and happiness obtained in the next life are called <span class="Italic">paratra.</span></div>
<A NAME="65360"></A><div id="65360"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Actually, Lord Mah&#257;deva (&#346;iva) is one of the great demigods within this material world. Generally his blessings bestowed on ordinary people mean material happiness. The predominating deity of this material world, Durg&#257;, is under the control of Lord Mah&#257;deva, Giri&#347;a. Thus Lord Mah&#257;deva can offer anyone any kind of material happiness. Generally people prefer to become devotees of Lord Giri&#347;a to obtain material happiness, but the Pracet&#257;s met Lord Mah&#257;deva by providential arrangement. Lord Mah&#257;deva instructed them to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he personally offered a prayer. As stated in the previous verse (<span class="Italic">rudra-g&#299;tena</span>), simply by chanting the prayers offered by Lord &#346;iva to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Pracet&#257;s were transferred to the spiritual world. Sometimes devotees desire to enjoy material happiness also; therefore, by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the devotee is given a chance to enjoy the material world before his final entrance into the spiritual world. Sometimes a devotee is transferred to a heavenly planet&mdash;to Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka, Siddhaloka and so on. However, a pure devotee never aspires for any kind of material happiness. The pure devotee is consequently transferred directly to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, which is described here as <span class="Italic">param.</span> In this verse Vidura asks Maitreya, the disciple of B&#7771;haspati, about the different achievements of the Pracet&#257;s.</div>

<div class="First">One can offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly, but if one repeats the prayers offered by great devotees like Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;, or if one follows in the footsteps of great personalities, one can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily.

He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of <span class="Italic">lak&#7779;m&#299;s,</span> or <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span>&rdquo; Because this prayer was offered by Lord Brahm&#257;, we follow him by reciting this prayer. That is the easiest way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The pure devotee never attempts to reach the Supreme Lord directly. The most important way to worship the Lord is to go through the disciplic succession of devotees. The prayers offered by Lord &#346;iva to the Supreme Personality of Godhead were thus repeated by the Pracet&#257;s, who were thus very successful in pleasing the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="Translation">At the end of ten thousand years of severe austerities performed by the Pracet&#257;s, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to reward their austerities, appeared before them in His very pleasing form. This appealed to the Pracet&#257;s and satisfied the labor of their austerities.</div>

<div class="First">Performing ten thousand years of severe austerities does not seem a happy endeavor. Yet the devotees, the serious students of spiritual life, undergo such austerities to attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At that time, when the duration of life was very long, people could undergo severe austerities for thousands of years. It is said that V&#257;lm&#299;ki, the author of <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> underwent meditational austerities for sixty thousand years. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appreciated the austerities undergone by the Pracet&#257;s, and He finally appeared before them in a pleasing form. Thus they all became satisfied and forgot the austerities they underwent. In the material world, if one is successful after hard labor, he is very pleased. Similarly, the devotee forgets all his labors and austerities as soon as he contacts the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was only a five-year-old boy, he underwent severe austerities by eating simply dry foliage, drinking only water and taking no food. In this way, after six months, he was able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. When he saw the Lord, he forgot all his austerities and said, <span class="Italic">sv&#257;min k&#7771;t&#257;rtho&rsquo;smi:</span> &ldquo;My dear Lord, I am very pleased.&rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="65391"></A><div id="65391"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Of course, these austerities were performed in the Satya-yuga, Dv&#257;para-yuga and Tret&#257;-yuga, but not in this age of Kali. In this Kali-yuga, one can attain the same results simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra.</span> Because the people of this age are fallen, the Lord is kind enough to give them the easiest method. Simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> one can attain the same results.

The helmet was dazzling and was very beautifully situated on His head. The Lord had eight arms, which each held a particular weapon. The Lord was surrounded by demigods, great sages and other associates. These were all engaged in His service.

<div class="First">Generally the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u form is manifested with four hands holding four objects (a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower). However, here Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is described as possessing eight arms with eight kinds of weapons. According to V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya, the conchshell and lotus flower are also accepted as weapons. Since the Lord is the supreme controller, whatever is in His hand can be considered a weapon. Four hands hold four kinds of weapons, and the extra four hands hold an arrow, bow, trident and snake. &#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya describes the eight weapons as <span class="Italic">&#347;a&#7749;kha, cakra, gad&#257;, padma, &#347;&#257;r&#7749;ga, &#347;ara,</span> etc.</div>

<div class="Purport">A king is always accompanied by his ministers, secretaries and commanders, and Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is also accompanied by His followers&mdash;the demigods, great sages, saintly persons and so on. He is never alone. Consequently there is no question of the Lord&rsquo;s being impersonal. He is always Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His associates are also persons. From the description given in this verse, Garu&#7693;a appears to belong to the Kinnara planet. The inhabitants of the Kinnara planet have the same features as Garu&#7693;a. Their bodily features are like those of a human being, but they have wings. The word <span class="Italic">g&#299;ta-k&#299;rti&#7717;</span> indicates that the inhabitants of Kinnaraloka are very expert in singing the glories of the Lord. In <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said: <span class="Italic">jagad-a&#7751;&#7693;a-ko&#7789;i-ko&#7789;i&#7779;v a&#347;e&#7779;a-vasudh&#257;di-vibh&#363;ti-bhinnam.</span> In each and every universe there are different types of planets, and each planet has distinctive features. On the strength of this verse, we can understand that in Kinnaraloka the inhabitants can fly with their wings. There is also a planet, known as Siddhaloka, where the inhabitants can fly even without wings. Thus each and every planet has some distinctive facility. That is the beauty of the varied creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">Since the sons of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at were all united in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, the Lord was very pleased with them. Each and every one of the sons of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at was an individual soul, but they were united in offering transcendental service to the Lord. The unity of the individual souls attempting to satisfy the Supreme Lord or rendering service to the Lord is real unity. In the material world such unity is not possible. Even though people may officially unite, they all have different interests. In the United Nations, for instance, all the nations have their particular national ambitions, and consequently they cannot be united. Disunity between individual souls is so strong within this material world that even in a society of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, members sometimes appear disunited due to their having different opinions and leaning toward material things. Actually, in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness there cannot be two opinions. There is only one goal: to serve K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to one&rsquo;s best ability. If there is some disagreement over service, such disagreement is to be taken as spiritual. Those who are actually engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be disunited in any circumstance. This makes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very happy and willing to award all kinds of benediction to His devotees, as indicated in this verse. We can see that the Lord is immediately prepared to award all benedictions to the sons of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at.</div>

<div class="Purport">One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracet&#257;s, the sons of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is the way of the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. If we follow the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> we attain the same benefit as our predecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like Arjuna, who formerly heard <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people argue that since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from Him. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and reading it, as long as one accepts <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as it is, spoken by the Lord. However, if one wants to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by his imperfect interpretations, one cannot possibly understand the mysteries of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> even though one may be a great scholar according to mundane estimation.</div>

<div class="First">Since every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has small independence. Sometimes unintelligent men ask why one is put into a miserable condition, even though everyone is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of his minute independence, the living entity can obey or disobey the orders of the Supreme Lord. If he obeys the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s orders, he becomes happy. If he does not, he becomes unhappy. Therefore the living entity creates his own happiness or unhappiness. The Supreme Lord does not enforce these on anyone. The Supreme Lord praised the Pracet&#257;s because they all faithfully obeyed the orders of their father. The Lord therefore blessed the sons of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at because they obeyed their father&rsquo;s orders.</div>

<div class="First">Whenever a great sage undergoes severe austerities for material power, the King of heaven, Indra, becomes very envious. All the demigods have responsible posts for the management of universal affairs and are very highly qualified with pious activities. Although they are ordinary living entities, they are able to attain responsible posts, like Lord Brahm&#257;, Indra, Candra and Varu&#7751;a. As is the nature of this material world, the King of heaven, Indra, is very anxious if a great sage undergoes severe austerities. The whole material world is filled with such envy that everyone becomes afraid of his neighbors. Every businessman is afraid of his associates because this material world is the field of activities for all kinds of envious people who have come here to compete with the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Indra was very much afraid of the severe austerities performed by the great sage Ka&#7751;&#7693;u, and he sent Pramloc&#257; to break his vows and austerities. A similar incident took place in the case of Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra. From other incidents in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> it appears that Indra has always been envious. When King P&#7771;thu was celebrating various sacrifices, outdoing Indra, Indra became very envious, and he disturbed King P&#7771;thu&rsquo;s sacrifice. This has already been discussed in previous chapters. King Indra became successful in breaking the vow of the great sage Ka&#7751;&#7693;u, who became attracted by the beauty of the heavenly society girl Pramloc&#257; and begot a female child. This child is described herein as lotus-eyed and very beautiful. Being thus successful in her mission, Pramloc&#257; returned to the heavenly planets, leaving the newborn child to the care of the trees. Fortunately, the trees accepted the child and agreed to raise her.</div>

<div class="First">According to Vedic principles, a woman cannot have many husbands, although a husband can have many wives. In special instances, however, it is found that a woman has more than one husband. Draupad&#299;, for instance, was married to all of the five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava brothers. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered all the sons of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at to marry the one girl born of the great sage Ka&#7751;&#7693;u and Pramloc&#257;. In special cases, a girl is allowed to marry more than one man, provided she is able to treat her husbands equally. This is not possible for an ordinary woman. Only one who is especially qualified can be allowed to marry more than one husband. In this age of Kali, to find such an equipoised woman is very difficult. Thus according to scripture, <span class="Italic">kalau paï¿½ca vivarjayet.</span> In this age a woman is forbidden to marry her husband&rsquo;s brother. This system is still practiced in some of the hilly tracts of India. The Lord says: <span class="Italic">ap&#7771;thag-dharma-&#347;&#299;leya&#7745; bh&#363;y&#257;t patny arpit&#257;&#347;ay&#257;.</span> With the blessings of the Lord, all things are possible. The Lord especially blessed the girl to surrender equally to all brothers. <span class="Italic">Ap&#7771;thag-dharma,</span> meaning &ldquo;occupational duty without difference of purpose,&rdquo; is taught in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> is divided into three primary divisions&mdash;<span class="Italic">karma-yoga, jï¿½&#257;na-yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> The word <span class="Italic">yoga</span> means &ldquo;acting on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.&rdquo; As confirmed by <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/9?d=1">3.9</a>):</div>

<div class="First">The duration of life prescribed for the Pracet&#257;s by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is calculated by the time measurements of higher planetary systems. Our six earth months are said to equal twelve hours in the higher planetary systems. Thirty days equal one month, and twelve months equal one year. In this way, for one million years according to the calculations of the higher planetary system the Pracet&#257;s were allowed to enjoy all kinds of material facilities. Although this life-span was so long, the Pracet&#257;s were given full bodily strength by the grace of the Lord. In the material world, if one wants to live for many years, he must endure the difficulties of old age, invalidity and many other miserable conditions. The Pracet&#257;s, however, were given full bodily strength to enjoy material facilities. This special facility was given to the Pracet&#257;s so that they could continue rendering full devotional service. This will be explained in the following verse.</div>

<div class="First">By the grace of the Lord, the Pracet&#257;s were given special facilities. Although they could live millions of years to enjoy material facilities, they still would not be deviated from the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Being thus fully engaged, the Pracet&#257;s would be completely freed from all material attachment. Material attachment is very strong. During one lifetime, a materialist engages in acquiring land, money, friends, society, friendship, love and so on. He also wants to enjoy the heavenly planets after the annihilation of the body. If one is engaged in devotional service, however, he becomes unattached to all kinds of material enjoyment and suffering. In the material world, those who are elevated to the higher planetary systems are supposed to enjoy all material facilities, whereas those degraded to lower planetary systems are supposed to live in a hellish condition. A devotee, however, is transcendental to both heavenly and hellish conditions. According to <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/14/26?d=1">14.26</a>), a devotee&rsquo;s position is described in this way:</div>

<A NAME="65587"></A><div id="65587"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A devotee is always situated on the Brahman platform. He has nothing to do with material happiness or distress. When one is strongly fixed in devotional service and free from all material attachment, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature, he becomes fit to return home, back to Godhead. Although by special blessing the Pracet&#257;s would enjoy material facilities for millions of years, they would not be attached to them. Thus at the end of their material enjoyment they would be promoted to the spiritual world and return to Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="65588"></A><div id="65588"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">pakva-gu&#7751;&#257;&#347;ay&#257;&#7717;</span> has special significance, for it means that by devotional service one is able to give up the influence of the three modes of material nature. As long as one is influenced by the modes of material nature, he cannot return to Godhead. It is clearly explained that all planets in the material world&mdash;beginning from Brahmaloka down to the hellish planets&mdash;are unfit places for a devotee. <span class="Italic">pada&#7745; pada&#7745; yad vipad&#257;&#7745; na te&#7779;&#257;m.</span> A place where there is danger at every step is certainly not a comfortable place.

<div class="Translation">Those who are engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service certainly understand that the ultimate enjoyer or beneficiary of all activities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="First">Generally a person living in a family becomes overly attached to fruitive activity. In other words, he tries to enjoy the results of his activities. A devotee, however, knows that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the supreme enjoyer and the supreme proprietor (<span class="Italic">bhokt&#257;ra&#7745; yajï¿½a-tapas&#257;&#7745; sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam </I>[Bg.</I> </span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/5/29?d=1">5.29</a>]). Consequently, the devotee does not consider himself the proprietor of any occupation. The devotee always thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the proprietor; therefore the results of his business are offered to the Supreme Lord. One who thus lives in the material world with his family and children never becomes affected by the contaminations of the material world. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/9?d=1">3.9</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">One who tries to enjoy the results of his activities becomes bound by the results. One who offers the results or profits to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, does not become entangled in the results. This is the secret of success. Generally people take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> to become free from the reactions of fruitive activity. One who does not receive the results of his actions but offers them instead to the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly remains in a liberated condition. In <span class="Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu,</span> &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; confirms this:</div>

Such a person is called a <span class="Italic">j&#299;van-mukta,</span> one who is liberated during this lifetime. Devoid of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, those who engage in material activities simply become more entangled in material bondage. They have to suffer and enjoy the actions and reactions of all activity. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore the greatest boon to humanity because it keeps one always engaged in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service. The devotees think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, act for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, eat for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, sleep for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and work for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus everything is engaged in the service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. A total life in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness saves one from material contamination. As stated by Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; Gosv&#257;m&#299; Mah&#257;r&#257;ja:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">If one is so expert that he can engage everything or dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, to give up the material world would be a great blunder. One should learn how to dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, for everything is connected to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. That is the real purpose of life and secret of success. As reiterated later in the Third Chapter of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/19?d=1">3.19</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">The Third Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> specifically considers material activities for the purpose of sense gratification and material activities for the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord. The conclusion is that these are not one and the same. Material activities for sense gratification are the cause of material bondage, whereas the very same activities for the satisfaction of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are the cause of liberation. How the same activity can be the cause of bondage and liberation can be explained as follows. One may get indigestion due to eating too many milk preparations&mdash;condensed milk, sweet rice, and so on. But even though there is indigestion or diarrhea, another milk preparation&mdash;yogurt mixed with black pepper and salt&mdash;will immediately cure these maladies. In other words, one milk preparation can cause indigestion and diarrhea, and another milk preparation can cure them.</div>
<A NAME="65614"></A><div id="65614"> </div>
<div class="Purport">If one is placed in material opulence due to the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he should not consider that opulence a cause for bondage. When a mature devotee is blessed with material opulence, he does not become affected adversely, for he knows how to employ material opulence in the service of the Lord. There are many such examples in the history of the world. There were kings like P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Janaka, Dhruva, Vaivasvata Manu and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku. All of these were great kings and were especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If a devotee is not mature, the Supreme Lord will take away all his opulence. This principle is stated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;<span class="Italic">yasy&#257;ham anug&#7771;h&#7751;&#257;mi hari&#7779;ye tad-dhana&#7745; &#347;anai&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;My first mercy shown to My devotee is to take away all his material opulence.&rdquo; Material opulence detrimental to devotional service is taken away by the Supreme Lord, whereas a person who is mature in devotional service is given all material facilities.</div>

<div class="Translation">Always engaging in the activities of devotional service, devotees feel ever-increasingly fresh and new in all their activities. The all-knower, the Supersoul within the heart of the devotee, makes everything increasingly fresh. This is known as the Brahman position by the advocates of the Absolute Truth. In such a liberated stage [brahma-bh&#363;ta], one is never bewildered. Nor does one lament or become unnecessarily jubilant. This is due to the brahma-bh&#363;ta situation.</div>

<div class="First">A devotee is inspired by the Supersoul within the heart to advance in devotional service in a variety of ways. The devotee does not feel hackneyed or stereotyped, nor does he feel that he is in a stagnant position. In the material world, if one engages in chanting a material name, he will feel tired after chanting a few times. However, one can chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> all day and night and never feel tired. As chanting is increased, it will come out new and fresh. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; said that if he could somehow get millions of ears and tongues, then he could relish spiritual bliss by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra.</span> There is really nothing uninspiring for a highly advanced devotee. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says that He is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart and that He helps the living entity forget and remember. By the grace of the Lord, the devotee gets inspiration.</div>

<div class="First">In the previous verse it has been said (<span class="Italic">g&#7771;h&#299;ta-m&#257;y&#257;-gu&#7751;a-vigrah&#257;ya</span>) that the Lord accepts three kinds of bodies (Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva) for the purposes of creating, maintaining and annihilating the cosmic manifestation. The three predominating deities of the material universe (Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and &#346;iva) are called <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a-avat&#257;ras.</span> There are many kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the first incarnations within this material world are Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Mahe&#347;vara (&#346;iva). Out of these three, Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva accept material bodies, but Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u does not accept a material body. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is therefore known as <span class="Italic">vi&#347;uddha-sattva.</span> His existence is completely free from the contamination of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is in the same category with Lord Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> forbid us to think in this way.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">One who considers Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to be in the same category with <span class="Italic">devas</span> like Lord Brahm&#257; or Lord &#346;iva or who thinks Lord Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva to be equal to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is to be considered as <span class="Italic">p&#257;&#7779;a&#7751;&#7693;&#299;</span> (a faithless nonbeliever).

His position is somewhere between Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahm&#257;, the living entity. Lord &#346;iva is therefore explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.45) in this way:</div>

<div class="First">The form of the Lord known as <span class="Italic">arc&#257;-vigraha</span> is an expansion of His unlimited potencies. When the Lord is gradually satisfied with the service of a devotee, in due course of time He accepts the devotee as one of His many unalloyed servants.

<div class="Purport">In this connection there is a story about a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> who was offering sweet rice to the Lord within his mind. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> had no money nor any means of worshiping the Deity, but within his mind he arranged everything nicely. He had gold pots to bring water from the sacred rivers to wash the Deity, and he offered the Deity very sumptuous food, including sweet rice. Once, before he offered the sweet rice, he thought that it was too hot, and he thought, &ldquo;Oh, let me test it. My, it is very hot.&rdquo; When he put his finger in the sweet rice to test it, his finger was burned and his meditation broken. Although he was offering food to the Lord within his mind, the Lord accepted it nonetheless. Consequently, the Lord in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha immediately sent a chariot to bring the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> back home, back to Godhead. Thus it is the duty of every sincere devotee to accept the <span class="Italic">arc&#257;-vigraha</span> at home or in the temple and worship the form of the Lord as advised in authorized scriptures and directed by the spiritual master.</div>

<div class="Translation">When the Lord, out of His natural compassion, thinks of His devotee, by that process only are all desires of the neophyte devotee fulfilled.

<div class="Purport">Whatever a living entity desires, however insignificant he may be, is noted by the Lord, who gives him a chance to fulfill his desires.

A pure devotee simply wants to engage in the service of the Lord without material desire, and if he wants this within the core of his heart, where the Lord is situated, and if he is without ulterior motive, why should the Lord not understand? If a sincere devotee renders service to the Lord or to the <span class="Italic">arc&#257;-vigraha,</span> the form of the Lord, all his activities prove successful because the Lord is present within his heart and understands his sincerity. Thus if a devotee, with all confidence, goes on discharging the prescribed duties of devotional service, he will ultimately attain success.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">apavarga-gurur gati&#7717;</span> are very significant. According to <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/11?d=1">1.2.11</a>), the Supreme Lord is the ultimate fact of the Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti param&#257;tmeti bhagav&#257;n iti &#347;abdyate.</span> The Absolute Truth is realized in three features&mdash;impersonal Brahman, localized Param&#257;tm&#257; and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagav&#257;n. The word <span class="Italic">apavarga</span> means &ldquo;liberation.&rdquo; <span class="Italic">pavarga</span> means &ldquo;material existence.&rdquo; In material existence, one always works very hard but is ultimately baffled. One then dies and has to accept another body to work very hard again. This is the cycle of material existence. <span class="Italic">Apavarga</span> means just the opposite. Instead of working hard like cats and dogs, one returns home, back to Godhead. Liberation begins with merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Lord. This conception is held by the <span class="Italic">jï¿½&#257;n&#299;-samprad&#257;ya,</span> philosophical speculators, but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is higher. When a devotee understands that the Lord is satisfied, liberation, or merging into the effulgence of the Lord, is not very difficult. One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the impersonal Brahman effulgence just as one has to approach the sun through the sunshine. It is not very difficult to merge into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, Brahman, if one has satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">There was no need for the Pracet&#257;s to ask any benediction from the Supreme Lord because the devotees are simply satisfied by the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja practiced severe austerities and penances to see the Supreme Lord, and his intention was to receive benediction from the Lord. He wanted to acquire the throne of his father&mdash;or attain an even better position&mdash;but when he was actually in the presence of the Supreme Lord, he forgot everything. He said, &ldquo;My dear Lord, I do not wish to ask any benediction.&rdquo; This is the actual position of the devotee. The devotee simply wants to be in the presence of the Supreme Lord&mdash;either in this world or in the next&mdash;and engage in His service. That is the ultimate goal and benediction for the devotees.</div>
<A NAME="65805"></A><div id="65805"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord asked the Pracet&#257;s to pray for some benediction, and they said, &ldquo;What kind of benediction should we pray for? The Lord is unlimited, and there are unlimited benedictions.&rdquo; The purport is that if one must ask for benediction, he must ask for unlimited benediction. The words <span class="Italic">tvat parata&#7717;</span> are very significant in this verse. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">parata&#7717; par&#257;t.</span> The word <span class="Italic">para</span> means &ldquo;transcendental, beyond this material world.&rdquo; The impersonal Brahman effulgence is beyond this material world, and this is called <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam.</span> <span class="Italic">&#256;ruhya k&#7771;cchre&#7751;a para&#7745; padam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/10/2/32?d=1">10.2.32</a>). Merging into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord is called <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam,</span> but there is a higher transcendental position, which is the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti param&#257;tmeti bhagav&#257;n iti &#347;abdyate</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/11?d=1">1.2.11</a>). The Absolute Truth is realized first as impersonal Brahman, then as Param&#257;tm&#257;, and finally as Bhagav&#257;n. Thus the Personality of Godhead, Bhagav&#257;n, is <span class="Italic">parata&#7717; par&#257;t,</span> beyond Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257; realization. In this connection, &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; points out that <span class="Italic">parata&#7717; par&#257;t</span> means &ldquo;better than the best.&rdquo; The best is the spiritual world, and it is known as Brahman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is known as Parabrahman. Therefore <span class="Italic">parata&#7717; par&#257;t</span> means &ldquo;better than Brahman realization.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Purport">As will be explained in the next verses, the Pracet&#257;s planned to ask the Lord for something that has no limit. The Lord&rsquo;s pastimes, qualities, forms and names are all unlimited. There is no limit to His name, forms, pastimes, creation and paraphernalia. The living entity cannot conceive of the unlimitedness of the unlimited. However, if living entities are engaged in hearing about the unlimited potencies of the Supreme Lord, they are factually connected directly to the unlimited. Such understanding of the unlimited becomes unlimited by hearing and chanting.</div>

<div class="Translation">Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material contamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, we pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes.

<div class="First">This is the best benediction that a devotee can ask of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: <span class="Italic">sth&#257;ne sthit&#257;&#7717; &#347;ruti-gat&#257;&#7745; tanu-v&#257;&#7749;-manobhi&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 10.14.3). One may be in one position or another according to destiny, but in any case one must continue to hear about the activities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, regardless of circumstances. A pure devotee does not pray for liberation or for cessation of the cycle of birth and death because he does not consider that important. The most important thing for a devotee is getting a chance to hear about the pastimes and glories of the Lord. The devotees who engage in the service of the Lord in this world will have the same opportunity in the spiritual world also. Thus for a devotee, everything is in the spiritual world, for as long as he can hear about the pastimes of the Lord, or wherever he can chant, the Lord is personally present. <span class="Italic">Tatra ti&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;mi n&#257;rada yatra g&#257;yanti mad-bhakt&#257;&#7717;.</span> When the pure devotees assemble to chant, hear and talk about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the place where they assemble becomes Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. For the devotee there is no need to pray to the Lord for transferal to the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha world. A pure devotee can create Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha or V&#7771;nd&#257;vana anywhere simply by chanting the glories of the Lord without offense.</div>

<div class="Purport">The Pracet&#257;s pray for an opportunity to hear of the glories of the Lord in every form of life (<span class="Italic">bhave bhave</span>). A living entity transmigrates from one body to another. The devotee is not particularly eager to stop this process. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu prays, <span class="Italic">mama janmani janman&#299;&#347;vare bhavat&#257;d bhaktir ahaituk&#299; tvayi:</span> &ldquo;My dear Lord, life after life may I be fixed in Your pure devotional service.&rdquo; Out of humility, a devotee considers himself unfit to be transferred to the spiritual world. He always thinks himself contaminated by the modes of material nature. Nor is there any need for a devotee to ask to be freed from the modes of material nature. Devotional service itself is in the transcendental position; therefore there is no question of asking for this special facility. The conclusion is that a pure devotee is not anxious to stop the repetition of birth and death, but is always eager to associate with other devotees who are engaged in chanting and hearing about the glories of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">The great saint Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299;, a devotee of Lord Caitanya, has stated: <span class="Italic">kaivalya&#7745; narak&#257;yate trida&#347;a-p&#363;r &#257;k&#257;&#347;a-pu&#7779;p&#257;yate.</span> For a pure devotee, <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> merging into the existence of Brahman, the Brahman effulgence, is no better than living in hell. Similarly, he considers promotion to heavenly planets (<span class="Italic">trida&#347;a-p&#363;r</span>) just another kind of phantasmagoria. In other words, a pure devotee does not place much value in the destination of the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> (the heavenly planets) or in the destination of the <span class="Italic">jï¿½&#257;n&#299;s</span> (merging into the Brahman effulgence). A pure devotee considers a moment&rsquo;s association with another pure devotee to be far superior to residing in a heavenly planet or merging in the Brahman effulgence. The topmost benediction for those who are living in this material world and are subjected to the repetition of birth and death (transmigration) is association with pure devotees. One should search out such pure devotees and remain with them. That will make one completely happy, even though living within the material world. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is started for that purpose. A person who is overly affected materially may take advantage of this movement and become intimately associated with it. In this way the confused and frustrated inhabitants of this material world may find the highest happiness in association with devotees.</div>

<div class="First">There are two kinds of devotees.

Such a devotee is always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He chants the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> as taught by many <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> and sometimes goes out for preaching work. The <span class="Italic">go&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;nand&#299;</span> is one who desires to increase the number of devotees all over the world. He travels all over the world just to purify the world and the people residing in it. Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu advised:</div>

N&#257;rada even made a hunter a devotee. He also made Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Prahl&#257;da devotees. Actually, all devotees are indebted to the great sage N&#257;rada, for he has wandered both in heaven and in hell. A devotee of the Lord is not even afraid of hell.

<div class="Purport">When a pure devotee goes to a place of pilgrimage, he desires to purify that holy place of pilgrimage. Many sinful men bathe in the holy waters of the places of pilgrimage. They take their baths in the waters of the Ganges and Yamun&#257; at places such as Pray&#257;ga, V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and Mathur&#257;. In this way the sinful men are purified, but their sinful actions and reactions remain at the holy places of pilgrimage. When a devotee comes to take his bath at those places of pilgrimage, the sinful reactions left by the sinful men are neutralized by the devotee. <span class="Italic">T&#299;rth&#299;-kurvanti t&#299;rth&#257;ni sv&#257;nta&#7717;-sthena gad&#257;-bh&#7771;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/13/10?d=1">1.13.10</a>). Because the devotee always carries the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, wherever he goes becomes a place of pilgrimage, a holy place for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore the duty of everyone to associate with a pure devotee and thus attain freedom from material contamination. Everyone should take advantage of the wandering devotees, whose only business is to deliver conditioned souls from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span></div>

<div class="First">It has been said: <span class="Italic">hari&#7745; vin&#257; na s&#7771;ti&#7745; taranti.</span> Without taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, one cannot attain relief from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> the repetition of birth, old age, disease and death. The Pracet&#257;s received the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of Lord &#346;iva. Lord &#346;iva is the supreme devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;av&#257;n&#257;&#7745; yath&#257; &#347;ambhu&#7717;:</span> the most exalted Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is Lord &#346;iva, and those who are actually devotees of Lord &#346;iva follow Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s advice and take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The so-called devotees of Lord &#346;iva, who are simply after material prosperity, are in a way deceived by Lord &#346;iva. He does not actually deceive them, because Lord &#346;iva has no business deceiving people, but because the so-called devotees of Lord &#346;iva want to be deceived, Lord &#346;iva, who is very easily pleased, allows them all kinds of material benedictions. These benedictions might ironically result in the destruction of the so-called devotees. For instance, R&#257;va&#7751;a took all material benediction from Lord &#346;iva, but the result was that he was ultimately destroyed with his family, kingdom and everything else because he misused Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s benediction. Because of his material power, he became very proud and puffed up so that he dared kidnap the wife of Lord R&#257;macandra. In this way he was ruined. To get material benedictions from Lord &#346;iva is not difficult, but actually these are not benedictions. The Pracet&#257;s received benediction from Lord &#346;iva, and as a result they attained the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This is real benediction. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> also worshiped Lord &#346;iva in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and the lord is still staying there as Gop&#299;&#347;vara. The <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> however, prayed that Lord &#346;iva bless them by giving them Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as their husband. There is no harm in worshiping the demigods, provided that one&rsquo;s aim is to return home, back to Godhead. Generally people go to the demigods for material benefit, as indicated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/20?d=1">7.20</a>):</div>

In this connection it is to be noted that sometimes in revealed scriptures Lord &#346;iva is described as being nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The point is that Lord &#346;iva and Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u are so intimately connected that there is no difference in opinion.

Nowhere in revealed scripture does Lord &#346;iva claim to be equal to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This is simply the creation of the so-called devotees of Lord &#346;iva, who claim that Lord &#346;iva and Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u are one. This is strictly forbidden in the <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-tantra:</span> <span class="Italic">yas tu n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a&#7745; devam.</span> Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257; are intimately connected as master and servants. <span class="Italic">&#346;iva-viriï¿½ci-nutam.</span> Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is honored and offered obeisances by Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257;. To consider that they are all equal is a great offense. They are all equal in the sense that Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others are His eternal servants.</div>

One who has actually understood Him surrenders unto Him after many, many births. We find all these qualifications in the Pracet&#257;s. They underwent severe austerities and penances within the water, and they did not take any food for a very long time. They practiced these austerities not for material benediction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. One may engage in any business&mdash;material or spiritual&mdash;but the purpose should be the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse presents a perfect picture of Vedic civilization. People training to become devotees should be respectful not only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also to those who are elderly in knowledge, who are &#256;ryans and actual devotees of the Lord.

It does not matter whether his duty is violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord, it must be performed. An &#256;ryan performs his duty. It is not that the &#256;ryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The &#256;ryans never maintain slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals.

<div class="First">Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva, Manu (the father of mankind), great saintly persons and also great sages who have elevated themselves to the transcendental platform through austerities and penance, as well as devotional service, are imperfect in knowledge compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the case with anyone within this material world. No one can be equal to the Supreme Lord in anything, certainly not in knowledge. Consequently, anyone&rsquo;s prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is never complete. It is not possible to measure the complete glories of the Supreme Lord, who is unlimited. Even the Lord Himself in His incarnation as Ananta, or &#346;e&#7779;a, cannot describe His own glories. Although Ananta has many thousands of faces and has been glorifying the Lord for many, many years, He could not find the limit of the glories of the Lord. Thus it is not possible to estimate the complete potencies and glories of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<A NAME="65949"></A><div id="65949"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Nonetheless, everyone in devotional service can offer essential prayers to the Lord. Everyone is situated in a relative position, and no one is perfect in glorifying the Lord. Beginning with Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva down to ourselves, everyone is the servant of the Supreme Lord. We are all situated in relative positions according to our own <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Yet every one of us can offer prayers with heart and soul as far as we can appreciate the Lord&rsquo;s glories. That is our perfection. Even when one is in the darkest region of existence, he is allowed to offer prayers to the Lord according to his own capacity. The Lord therefore says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/32?d=1">9.32</a>):</div>

Lord Brahm&#257; also came when Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu underwent severe penances and austerities and made the whole universe tremble. A responsible man in any establishment is always alert to keep peace and harmony within the establishment. Similarly, Lord Brahm&#257; is also allowed to keep peace and harmony within this universe.

<div class="First">The daughter of the trees is referred to in text 13 of this chapter. This daughter was born of Ka&#7751;&#7693;u and Pramloc&#257;. The society girl Pramloc&#257;, after giving birth to the child, immediately left for the heavenly kingdom. While the child was crying, the king of the moon took compassion upon her and saved her by putting his finger into her mouth. This child was cared for by the trees, and when she grew up, by the order of Lord Brahm&#257;, she was delivered to the Pracet&#257;s as their wife. The name of the girl was M&#257;ri&#7779;&#257;, as the next verse will explain. It was the predominating deity of the trees that delivered the daughter. In this connection, &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; Prabhup&#257;da states, <span class="Italic">v&#7771;k&#7779;&#257;&#7717; tad-adhi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;t&#7771;-devat&#257;&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;The &lsquo;trees&rsquo; means the controlling deity of those trees.&rdquo; In Vedic literatures we find that there is a controlling deity of the water; similarly, there is a controlling deity of the trees. The Pracet&#257;s were engaged in burning all the trees to ashes, and they considered the trees their enemies. To pacify the Pracet&#257;s, the predominating deity of the trees, under the advice of Lord Brahm&#257;, delivered the daughter M&#257;ri&#7779;&#257;.</div>

<div class="First">In this connection the word <span class="Italic">mahad-avajï¿½&#257;n&#257;t</span> is significant.

Not only that, but because of his disrespecting Lord &#346;iva, he had to undergo the tribulation of taking birth from within the womb of a woman. In the Dak&#7779;a-yajï¿½a arena, he was once killed by Lord &#346;iva&rsquo;s servant, V&#299;rabhadra. Because that was not sufficient, he again took birth, from the womb of M&#257;ri&#7779;&#257;. At the end of the Dak&#7779;a-yajï¿½a and the disastrous incidents there, Dak&#7779;a offered his prayer to Lord &#346;iva. Although he had to give up his body and take birth from the womb of a woman impregnated by the semen of a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> he received all opulence by the grace of Lord &#346;iva. These are the subtle laws of material nature. Unfortunately, people in this modern age do not know how these laws are working. Having no knowledge of the eternity of the spirit soul and its transmigration, the population of the present age is in the greatest ignorance. Because of this, it is said in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/10?d=1">1.1.10</a>): <span class="Italic">mand&#257;&#7717; sumanda-matayo manda-bh&#257;gy&#257; hy upadrut&#257;&#7717;.</span> The total population in this age of Kali-yuga is very bad, lazy, unfortunate and disturbed by material conditions.</div>

<div class="Translation">After being born, Dak&#7779;a, by the superexcellence of his bodily luster, covered all others&rsquo; bodily opulence. Because he was very expert in performing fruitive activity, he was called by the name Dak&#7779;a, meaning &ldquo;the very expert.&rdquo; Lord Brahm&#257; therefore engaged Dak&#7779;a in the work of generating living entities and maintaining them. In due course of time, Dak&#7779;a also engaged other Praj&#257;patis [progenitors] in the process of generation and maintenance.</div>

<div class="First">Dak&#7779;a became almost as powerful as Lord Brahm&#257;. Consequently, Lord Brahm&#257; engaged him in generating population. Dak&#7779;a was very influential and opulent. In his own turn, Dak&#7779;a engaged other Praj&#257;patis, headed by Mar&#299;ci. In this way the population of the universe increased.</div>
