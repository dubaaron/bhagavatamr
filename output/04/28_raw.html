<div class="First">The period of life just prior to death is certainly very dangerous because usually at this time people are attacked by the weakness of old age as well as many kinds of disease. The diseases that attack the body are compared here to soldiers. These soldiers are not ordinary soldiers, for they are guided by the King of the Yavanas, who acts as their commander-in-chief. The word <span class="Italic">di&#7779;&#7789;a-k&#257;ri&#7751;a&#7717;</span> indicates that he is their commander. When a man is young, he does not care for old age, but enjoys sex to the best of his satisfaction, not knowing that at the end of life his sexual indulgence will bring on various diseases, which so much disturb the body that one will pray for immediate death. The more one enjoys sex during youth, the more he suffers in old age.</div>

<div class="Translation">Once the dangerous soldiers attacked the city of Pura�jana with great force. Although the city was full of paraphernalia for sense gratification, it was being protected by the old serpent.</div>

<div class="First">As one&rsquo;s body engages in sense gratification, it becomes weaker and weaker daily. Finally the vital force becomes so weak that it is herein compared to a weak serpent. The life air has already been compared to the serpent. When the vital force within the body becomes weak, the body itself also becomes weak. At such a time the death symptoms&mdash;that is, the dangerous soldiers of death&rsquo;s superintendent, Yamar&#257;ja&mdash;begin to attack very severely. According to the Vedic system, before coming to such a stage one should leave home and take <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> to preach the message of God for the duration of life. However, if one sits at home and is served by his beloved wife and children, he certainly becomes weaker and weaker due to sense gratification. When death finally comes, one leaves the body devoid of spiritual assets. At the present time, even the oldest man in the family does not leave home, being attracted by wife, children, money, opulence, dwelling, etc. Thus at the end of life one worries about how his wife will be protected and how she will manage the great family responsibilities. In this way a man usually thinks of his wife before death. According to <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/8/6?d=1">8.6</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">At the end of life, a person thinks of what he has done throughout his whole life; thus he gets another body (<span class="Italic">deh&#257;ntara</span>) according to his thoughts and desires at the end of life. One overly addicted to life at home naturally thinks of his beloved wife at the end of life. Consequently, in the next life he gets the body of a woman, and he also acquires the results of his pious or impious activities. In this chapter the acceptance of a woman&rsquo;s body by King Pura�jana will be thoroughly explained.</div>

<div class="First">At the fag end of life, when the invalidity of old age attacks a man, his body becomes useless for all purposes. Therefore Vedic training dictates that when a man is in his boyhood he should be trained in the process of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya;</span> that is, he should be completely engaged in the service of the Lord and should not in any way associate with women. When the boy becomes a young man, he marries between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. When he is married at the right age, he can immediately beget strong, healthy sons. Now female descendants are increasing because young men are very weak sexually. A male child will be born if the husband is sexually stronger than the wife, but if the female is stronger, a female child will be born. Thus it is essential to practice the system of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span> if one wishes to beget a male child when one is married. When one reaches the age of fifty, he should give up family life. At that time one&rsquo;s child should be grown up so that the father can leave the family responsibilities to him. The husband and wife may then go abroad to live a retired life and travel to different places of pilgrimage. When both the husband and wife lose their attachment for family and home, the wife returns home to live under the care of her grown-up children and to remain aloof from family affairs. The husband then takes <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> to render some service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="63131"></A><div id="63131"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This is the perfect system of civilization. The human form of life is especially meant for God realization. If one is unable to take to the process of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness from the very beginning of life, he must be trained to accept these principles at the fag end of life. Unfortunately, there is no training even in childhood, nor can one give up his family life even at the end. This is the situation with the city of Pura�jana, figuratively described in these verses.</div>

<div class="First">The body has nine gates&mdash;the two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, rectum and genitals. When one is harassed by the invalidity of old age, various diseases manifest at the gates of the body. For example, the eyes become so dim that one requires spectacles, and the ears become too weak to hear directly, and therefore one requires hearing aids. The nostrils are blocked by mucus, and one has to always sniff a medicinal bottle containing ammonia. Similarly, the mouth, too weak to chew, requires false teeth. The rectum also gives one trouble, and the evacuation process becomes difficult. Sometimes one has to take enemas and sometimes use a surgical nozzle to accelerate the passing of urine. In this way the city of Pura�jana was attacked at various gates by the soldiers. Thus in old age all the gates of the body are blocked by so many diseases, and one has to take help from so many medicines and surgical appliances.</div>

<div class="First">When we refer to the body, we include the external gross body with its various limbs, as well as the mind, intelligence and ego. In old age these all become weak when they are attacked by different diseases. The proprietor of the body, the living soul, becomes very sad at not being able to use the field of activities properly. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is clearly explained that the living entity is the proprietor of this body (<span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra j�a</span>) and that the body is the field of activities (<span class="Italic">k&#7779;etra</span>). When a field is overgrown with thorns and weeds, it becomes very difficult for the owner to work it. That is the position of the spirit soul when the body itself becomes a burden due to disease. Extra burdens are placed on the body in the form of anxiety and general deterioration of the bodily functions.</div>

<div class="First">When one becomes an invalid, his senses and organs are weakened. In other words, they are no longer under one&rsquo;s control. The senses and sense objects then begin to oppose him. When a person is in a distressed condition, even his family members&mdash;his sons, grandsons and wife&mdash;become disrespectful. They no longer are under the command of the master of the house. Just as we wish to use our senses for sense gratification, the senses also require strength from the body in reciprocation. A man keeps a family for enjoyment, and similarly family members demand enjoyment from the head of the family. When they do not receive sufficient money from him, they grow disinterested and ignore his commands or desires. This is all due to one&rsquo;s being a <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;a</span> (miser). This word <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;a,</span> used in the sixth verse, is in opposition to the word <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In the human form of life one should become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> which means that one should understand the constitutional position of the Absolute Truth, Brahman, and then engage in His service as a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. We get this facility in the human form of life, but if we do not properly utilize this opportunity, we become a <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;a,</span> miser. A miser is one who gets money but does not spend it properly. This human form of life is especially meant for understanding Brahman, for becoming a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> and if we do not utilize it properly, we remain a <span class="Italic">k&#7771;pa&#7751;a.</span> We can actually see that when one has money but does not spend it, he remains a miser and is never happy. Similarly, when one&rsquo;s intelligence is spoiled due to sense gratification, he remains a miser throughout his life.</div>

<div class="First">The living entity, separated from the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, tries to enjoy this material world. He is given a chance to enjoy it in a particular type of body, beginning with the body of a Brahm&#257; down to that of the microbe. From the Vedic history of creation we can understand that the first living creature was Lord Brahm&#257;, who created the seven great sages and other Praj&#257;patis to increase the universal population. Thus every living entity, according to <span class="Italic">karma,</span> his past desires and activities, gets a particular type of body, from that of Brahm&#257; to that of a microbe or germ in stool. Due to long association with a particular type of material body and also due to the grace of K&#257;lakany&#257; and her <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> one becomes overly attached to a material body, although it is the abode of pain. Even if one tries to separate a worm from stool, the worm will be unwilling to leave. It will return to the stool. Similarly, a hog generally lives in a very filthy state, eating stool, but if one tries to separate it from its condition and give it a nice place, the hog will be unwilling. In this way if we study each and every living entity, we will find that he will defy offers of a more comfortable position. Although King Pura�jana was attacked from all sides, he was unwilling to leave the city. In other words, the living entity&mdash;whatever his condition&mdash;does not want to give up the body. But he will be forced to give it up because, after all, this material body cannot exist forever.</div>
<A NAME="63223"></A><div id="63223"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The living entity wishes to enjoy the material world in different ways, and therefore by nature&rsquo;s law he is allowed to transmigrate from one body to another, exactly as a person transmigrates from the body of an infant to a child to a boy to a youth to a man. This process is constantly going on. At the last stage, when the gross body becomes old and invalid, the living entity is reluctant to give it up, despite the fact that it is no longer usable. Although material existence and the material body are not comfortable, why does the living entity not want to leave? As soon as one gets a material body, he has to work very hard to maintain it. He may engage in different fields of activity, but whatever the case, everyone has to work very hard to maintain the material body. Unfortunately, society has no information of the soul&rsquo;s transmigration. Because the living entity does not hope to enter the spiritual kingdom of eternal life, bliss and knowledge, he wants to stick to his present body, even though it may be useless. Consequently, the greatest welfare activity in this material world is the furthering of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement.</div>
<A NAME="63224"></A><div id="63224"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This movement is giving human society information about the kingdom of God. There is God, there is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and everyone can return to God and live eternally in bliss and knowledge. A K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person is not afraid of giving up the body because his position is always eternal. A K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord eternally; therefore as long as he lives within the body, he is happy to engage in the loving service of the Lord, and when he gives up the body, he is also permanently situated in the service of the Lord. The saintly devotees are always free and liberated, whereas the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> who have no knowledge of spiritual life or the transcendental loving service of the Lord, are very much afraid of giving up the rotten material body.</div>

This means that the body is in such severe pain that one becomes unconscious and cannot feel the miseries taking place within the body. Indeed, the living entity becomes so helpless at the time of death that, although unwilling, he is forced to give up the body and enter another. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated that man may, by scientific advancement, improve the temporary living conditions, but that he cannot avoid the pangs of birth, old age, disease and death. These are under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of material nature. A foolish person cannot understand this simple fact. Now people are very busy trying to find petroleum in the midst of the ocean. They are very anxious to make provisions for the future petroleum supply, but they do not make any attempts to ameliorate the conditions of birth, old age, disease and death.

<div class="First">The living entity is covered by two different types of bodies&mdash;the gross body and the subtle body. At death we can see that the gross body is finished, but actually the living entity is carried by the subtle body to another gross body. The so-called scientists of the modern age cannot see how the subtle body is working in carrying the soul from one body to another. This subtle body has been figuratively described as a serpent, or the city&rsquo;s police superintendent. When there is fire everywhere, the police superintendent cannot escape either. When there is security and an absence of fire in the city, the police superintendent can impose his authority upon the citizens, but when there is an all-out attack on the city, he is rendered useless. As the life air was ready to leave the gross body, the subtle body also began to experience pain.</div>

<div class="First">It is clear in this verse that at the time of death thoughts of material enjoyment do not go away. This indicates that the living entity, the soul, is carried by the subtle body&mdash;mind, intelligence and ego. Due to false ego, the living entity still wants to enjoy the material world, and for want of material enjoyment he becomes sorry or sad. He still makes intellectual plans to further his existence, and therefore, although he gives up the gross body, he is carried by the subtle body to another gross body. The transmigration of the subtle body is never visible to material eyes; therefore when one gives up the gross body, we think that he is finished. Plans for material enjoyment are made by the subtle body, and the gross body is the instrument for enjoying these plans. Thus the gross body can be compared to the wife, for the wife is the agent for all kinds of sense gratification. Because of long association with the gross body, the living entity becomes very sad to be separated from it. The mental activity of the living entity obliges him to accept another gross body and continue his material existence.</div>

<div class="First">A wife is always supposed to be submissive to her husband. Submission, mild behavior and subservience are qualities in a wife which make a husband very thoughtful of her. For family life it is very good for a husband to be attached to his wife, but it is not very good for spiritual advancement. Thus K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness must be established in every home. If a husband and wife are very much attached to one another in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, they will both benefit because K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the center of their existence. Otherwise, if the husband is too much attached to his wife, he becomes a woman in his next life. The woman, being overly attached to her husband, becomes a man in her next life. Of course, it is an advantage for a woman to become a man, but it is not at all advantageous for the man to become a woman.</div>

<div class="Purport">The living entity is, after all, part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In other words, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s constitutional position and the living entity&rsquo;s constitutional position are the same qualitatively. The only difference is that the living entity is eternally an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. <span class="Italic">Mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717; san&#257;tana&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/7?d=1">15.7</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I>.</span> In this material world of conditional life, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord, the individual soul, is struggling due to his contaminated mind and consciousness. As part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, a living entity is supposed to think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but here we see that King Pura�jana (the living entity) is thinking of a woman. Such mental absorption with some sense object brings about the living entity&rsquo;s struggle for existence in this material world. Since King Pura�jana is thinking of his wife, his struggle for existence in the material world will not be ended by death. As revealed in the following verses, King Pura�jana had to accept the body of a woman in his next life due to his being overly absorbed in thoughts of his wife. Thus mental absorption in social, political, pseudoreligious, national and communal consciousness is cause for bondage. During one&rsquo;s lifetime one has to change his activities in order to attain release from bondage. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/9?d=1">3.9</a>). <span class="Italic">Yaj�&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o &rsquo;nyatra loko &rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;.</span> If we do not change our consciousness in this life, whatever we do in the name of social, political, religious or communal and national welfare will be the cause of our bondage. This means we have to continue in material, conditional life. As explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/7?d=1">15.7</a>), <span class="Italic">mana&#7717;-&#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;&#7751;i prak&#7771;ti-sth&#257;ni kar&#7779;ati.</span> When the mind and senses are engaged in material activities, one has to continue his material existence and struggle to attain happiness. In each and every life one is engaged in the struggle to become happy. Actually no one in this material world is happy, but the struggle gives a false sense of happiness. A person must work very hard, and when he attains the result of his hard work, he thinks himself happy. In the material world people do not know what real happiness is. <span class="Italic">Sukham &#257;tyantika&#7745; yat tad buddhi-gr&#257;hyam at&#299;ndriyam</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/6/20-23?d=1">6.21</a>). Real happiness must be appreciated by one&rsquo;s transcendental senses. Unless one is purified, the transcendental senses are not manifest; therefore to purify the senses one must take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Then there will be real happiness and liberation.</div>

Since Pura�jana is thinking of his wife and children and is overly engrossed in thoughts of his wife, he will accept the body of a woman. Similarly, a politician or so-called nationalist who is inordinately attached to the land of his birth will certainly be reborn in the same land after ending his political career. One&rsquo;s next life will also be affected by the acts one performs during this life. Sometimes politicians act most sinfully for their own sense gratification.

<div class="First">Foolish people do not know that every individual soul is responsible for his own actions and reactions in life. As long as a living entity in the form of a child or boy is innocent, it is the duty of the father and mother to lead him into a proper understanding of the values of life. When a child is grown, it should be left up to him to execute the duties of life properly. The parent, after his death, cannot help his child. A father may leave some estate for his children&rsquo;s immediate help, but he should not be overly absorbed in thoughts of how his family will survive after his death. This is the disease of the conditioned soul. Not only does he commit sinful activities for his own sense gratification, but he accumulates great wealth to leave behind so that his children may also gorgeously arrange for sense gratification.</div>

<div class="Purport">In any case, everyone is afraid of death, and therefore death is called <span class="Italic">bhaya,</span> or fear. Although King Pura�jana was engaged in thinking of his wife and children, death did not wait for him. Death does not wait for any man; it will immediately carry out its duty. Since death must take away the living entity without hesitation, it is the ultimate God realization of the atheists, who spoil their lives thinking of country, society and relatives, to the neglect of God consciousness. In this verse the word <span class="Italic">atad-arha&#7751;am</span> is very significant, for it means that one should not be overly engaged in welfare activities for one&rsquo;s family members, countrymen, society and community. None of these will help a person to advance spiritually. Unfortunately, in present-day society so-called educated men have no idea what spiritual progress is. Although they have the opportunity in the human form of life to make spiritual progress, they remain misers. They use their lives improperly and simply waste them thinking about the material welfare of their relatives, countrymen, society and so on. One&rsquo;s actual duty is to learn how to conquer death.

<div class="After-Verse">A person can be in full K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and become happy and satisfied if he knows but three things&mdash;namely, that the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the enjoyer of all benefits, that He is the proprietor of everything, and that He is the supreme friend of all living entities. If one does not know this and functions instead under the bodily conception, he is always harassed by the tribulations offered by material nature. In actuality, the Supreme Lord is sitting by the side of everyone. <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;vara&#7717; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745; h&#7771;d-de&#347;e &rsquo;rjuna ti&#7779;&#7789;hati</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/61?d=1">18.61</a>). The living entity and the Supersoul are sitting side by side in the same tree, but despite being harassed by the laws of material nature, the foolish living entity does not turn toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead for protection. However, he thinks that he is able to protect himself from the stringent laws of material nature. This, however, is not possible. The living entity must turn toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. Only then will he be saved from the onslaught of the powerful Yavana, or Yamar&#257;ja.</div>
<A NAME="63440"></A><div id="63440"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">sakh&#257;yam</span> (&ldquo;friend&rdquo;) is very significant in this verse because God is eternally present beside the living entity. The Supreme Lord is also described as <span class="Italic">su&#7717;rdam</span> (&ldquo;ever well-wisher&rdquo;). The Supreme Lord is always a well-wisher, just like a father or mother. Despite all the offenses of a son, the father and mother are always the son&rsquo;s well-wisher. Similarly, despite all our offenses and defiance of the desires of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord will give us immediate relief from all the hardships offered by material nature if we simply surrender unto Him, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/14?d=1">7.14</a>]). Unfortunately, due to our bad association and great attachment for sense gratification, we do not remember our best friend, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;&#7745;sa</span> (&ldquo;meat&rdquo;) indicates that those animals whom we kill will be given an opportunity to kill us. Although in actuality no living entity is killed, the pains of being pierced by the horns of animals will be experienced after death. Not knowing this, rascals unhesitatingly go on killing poor animals. So-called human civilization has opened many slaughterhouses for animals in the name of religion or food. Those who are a little religious kill animals in temples, mosques or synagogues, and those who are more fallen maintain various slaughterhouses. Just as in civilized human society the law is a life for a life, no living entity can encroach upon another living entity as far as the Supreme Lord is concerned. Everyone should be given freedom to live at the cost of the supreme father, and animal-killing&mdash;either for religion or for food&mdash;is always condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="Purport">When a living entity is accustomed to think of a particular subject matter or become absorbed in a certain type of thought, he will think of that subject at the time of death. At the time of death, one will think of the subject that has occupied his life while he was awake, lightly sleeping or dreaming, or while he was deeply sleeping. After falling from the association of the Supreme Lord, the living entity thus transmigrates from one bodily form to another according to nature&rsquo;s course, until he finally attains the human form. If he is absorbed in material thoughts and ignorant of spiritual life, and if he does not take shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who solves all questions of birth and death, he will become a woman in the next life, especially if he thinks of his wife.

Although King Pura�jana was overly attached to his wife, he nonetheless performed many pious fruitive activities. Consequently, although he took the form of a woman, he was given a chance to be the daughter of a powerful king. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/6/41?d=1">6.41</a>):</div>

Although King Pura�jana was overly absorbed in thoughts of his wife and thus became a woman, he took birth in the family of a king due to his previous pious activities. The conclusion is that all our activities are taken into consideration before we are awarded another body. N&#257;rada Muni therefore advised Vy&#257;sadeva that one should take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, devotional service, and abandon all ordinary occupational duties. This advice was also given by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself. Although a devotee may fall from the path of spiritual consciousness, he will nonetheless attain a human body in the home of a devotee or a rich man. In this way one can resume his devotional service.</div>

<div class="Translation">It was fixed that Vaidarbh&#299;, daughter of King Vidarbha, was to be married to a very powerful man, Malayadhvaja, an inhabitant of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u country. After conquering other princes, he married the daughter of King Vidarbha.</div>

<div class="First">It is customary among <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> for a princess to be offered under certain conditions. For instance, Draupad&#299; was offered in marriage to one who could pierce a fish with an arrow simply by seeing the reflection of that fish. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a married one of His queens after conquering seven strong bulls. The Vedic system is for a daughter of a king to be offered under certain conditions. Vaidarbh&#299;, the daughter of Vidarbha, was offered to a great devotee and powerful king. Since King Malayadhvaja was both a powerful king and great devotee, he fulfilled all the requirements. The name Malayadhvaja signifies a great devotee who stands as firm as Malaya Hill and, through his propaganda, makes other devotees similarly as firm. Such a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata</span> can prevail over the opinions of all others. A strong devotee makes propaganda against all other spiritual conceptions&mdash;namely <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na, karma</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> With his devotional flag unfurled, he always stands fast to conquer other conceptions of transcendental realization. Whenever there is an argument between a devotee and a nondevotee, the pure, strong devotee comes out victorious.</div>
<A NAME="63505"></A><div id="63505"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">p&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ya</span> comes from the word <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;&#257;,</span> meaning &ldquo;knowledge.&rdquo; Unless one is highly learned, he cannot conquer nondevotional conceptions. The word <span class="Italic">para</span> means &ldquo;transcendental,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">pura</span> means &ldquo;city.&rdquo; The <span class="Italic">para-pura</span> is Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, the kingdom of God, and the word <span class="Italic">jaya</span> refers to one who can conquer. This means that a pure devotee, who is strong in devotional service and who has conquered all nondevotional conceptions, can also conquer the kingdom of God. In other words, one can conquer the kingdom of God, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, only by rendering devotional service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called <span class="Italic">ajita,</span> meaning that no one can conquer Him, but a devotee, by strong devotional service and sincere attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can easily conquer Him. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is fear personified for everyone, but He voluntarily agreed to fear the stick of mother Ya&#347;od&#257;. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, God, cannot be conquered by anyone but His devotee. Such a devotee kindly married the daughter of King Vidarbha.</div>

<div class="First">King Malayadhvaja was a great devotee, and after he married the daughter of King Vidarbha, he gave her one nice daughter, whose eyes were black. Figuratively this means that the daughter of King Malayadhvaja was also bestowed with devotional service, for her eyes were always fixed on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. A devotee has no vision in his life other than K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The seven sons are the seven processes of devotional service&mdash;hearing, chanting, remembering, offering worship, offering prayers, rendering transcendental loving service and serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Of the nine types of devotional service, only seven were immediately given. The balance&mdash;friendship and surrendering everything&mdash;were to be developed later. In other words, devotional service is divided into two categories&mdash;namely <span class="Italic">vidhi-m&#257;rga</span> and <span class="Italic">r&#257;ga-m&#257;rga.</span> The process of becoming friends with the Lord and sacrificing everything for Him belongs to the category of <span class="Italic">r&#257;ga-m&#257;rga,</span> the stage of developed devotional service. For the neophyte, the important processes are those of hearing and chanting (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtanam</span>), remembering K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, worshiping the Deity in the temple, offering prayers and always engaging in the service of the Lord, and worshiping the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>

Actually, the entire world should be divided among such disciples. Everyone should be engaged in preaching the cult of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In other words, when disciples are grown up and are able to preach, the spiritual master should retire and sit down in a solitary place to write and execute <span class="Italic">nirjana-bhajana.</span> This means sitting silently in a solitary place and executing devotional service. This <span class="Italic">nirjana-bhajana,</span> which is the silent worship of the Supreme Lord, is not possible for a neophyte devotee. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura never advised a neophyte devotee to go to a solitary place to engage in devotional service. Indeed, he has written a song in this connection:</div>

Only when one is mature can he sit in a solitary place and retire from preaching all over the world. Following this example, the devotees of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness now render service as preachers in various parts of the world. Now they can allow the spiritual master to retire from active preaching work. In the last stage of the spiritual master&rsquo;s life, the devotees of the spiritual master should take preaching activities into their own hands.

<div class="First">We can definitely see that to advance in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness one must control his bodily weight. If one becomes too fat, it is to be assumed that he is not advancing spiritually. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura severely criticized his fat disciples. The idea is that one who intends to advance in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness must not eat very much. Devotees used to go to forests, high hills or mountains on pilgrimages, but such severe austerities are not possible in these days. One should instead eat only <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> and no more than required. According to the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava calendar, there are many fasts, such as Ek&#257;da&#347;&#299; and the appearance and disappearance days of God and His devotees. All of these are meant to decrease the fat within the body so that one will not sleep more than desired and will not become inactive and lazy. Overindulgence in food will cause a man to sleep more than required. This human form of life is meant for austerity, and austerity means controlling sex, food intake, etc. In this way time can be saved for spiritual activity, and one can purify himself both externally and internally. Thus both body and mind can be cleansed.</div>

Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a points out that it is the relativities like winter and summer that give us trouble in the material world. In the winter we do not like taking a bath, but in the summer we wish to take a bath twice, thrice or more a day.

King Malayadhvaja underwent severe austerities by leaving his home, going to Kul&#257;cala, taking his bath in the sacred rivers and eating only vegetables like stems, roots, seeds, flowers and leaves, avoiding any cooked food or grains. These are very, very austere practices. In this age it is very difficult to leave home and go to the forest or the Himalayas to adopt the processes of austerity. Indeed, it is almost impossible. If one is even advised to give up meat-eating, drinking, gambling and illicit sex, one will fail to do so. What, then, would a person do if he went to the Himalayas or Kul&#257;cala? Such acts of renunciation are not possible in this age; therefore Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has advised us to accept the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> will automatically liberate a person from the dualities of life.

According to the calculations of the demigods, one day (twelve hours) is equal to six months on earth. A hundred years of the demigods would equal thirty-six thousand earth years. Thus King Malayadhvaja executed austerities and penances for thirty-six thousand years. After this time, he became fixed in the devotional service of the Lord.

There are two types of M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers&mdash;the followers of the Buddhist philosophy and the followers of the &#346;a&#7749;kara philosophy. The followers of Buddha do not recognize that there is anything beyond the body; the followers of &#346;a&#7749;kara conclude that there is no separate existence of the Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supersoul. The &#346;a&#7749;karites believe that the individual soul is identical with the Param&#257;tm&#257; in the ultimate analysis. But the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosopher, who is perfect in knowledge, knows that the body is made of the external energy and that the Supersoul, the Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is sitting with the individual soul and is distinct from him.

At that time he sees everything in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Supreme Personality of Godhead in everything. Having attained this stage of understanding, he sees no distinction between the spiritual and material worlds. In perfect vision, the material world becomes the spiritual world due to its being the external energy of the Supreme Lord. For the perfect devotee, the energy and the energetic are nondifferent.

<div class="Translation">The daughter of King Vidarbha wore old garments, and she was lean and thin because of her vows of austerity. Since she did not arrange her hair, it became entangled and twisted in locks. Although she remained always near her husband, she was as silent and unagitated as the flame of an undisturbed fire.</div>

<div class="First">When one begins to burn firewood, there is smoke and agitation in the beginning. Although there are so many disturbances in the beginning, once the fire is completely set, the firewood burns steadily. Similarly, when both husband and wife follow the regulative principles of austerity, they remain silent and are not agitated by sex impulses. At such a time both husband and wife are benefited spiritually. One can attain this stage of life by completely giving up a luxurious mode of life.</div>
<A NAME="63718"></A><div id="63718"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">c&#299;ra-v&#257;s&#257;</span> refers to very old torn garments. The wife especially should remain austere, not desiring luxurious dresses and living standards. She should accept only the bare necessities of life and minimize her eating and sleeping. There should be no question of mating. Simply by engaging in the service of her exalted husband, who must be a pure devotee, the wife will never be agitated by sex impulses. The <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> stage is exactly like this. Although the wife remains with the husband, she undergoes severe austerities and penances so that although both husband and wife live together, there is no question of sex. In this way both husband and wife can live together perpetually. Since the wife is weaker than the husband, this weakness is expressed in this verse with the words <span class="Italic">upa patim.</span> <span class="Italic">Upa</span> means &ldquo;near to,&rdquo; or &ldquo;almost equal to.&rdquo; Being a man, the husband is generally more advanced than his wife. Nonetheless, the wife is expected to give up all luxurious habits. She should not even dress nicely or comb her hair. Hair combing is one of the main businesses of women. In the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> stage the wife should not take care of her hair. Thus her hair will become tangled in knots. Consequently the wife will no longer be attractive to the husband, and she herself will no longer be agitated by sex impulses. In this way both husband and wife can advance in spiritual consciousness. This advanced stage is called the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage, and once it is obtained, both husband and wife can be actually liberated from bodily consciousness. If the disciple remains steady in the service of the spiritual master, he need no longer fear falling down into the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span></div>

<div class="First">It is the long-standing tradition of the Vedic system that a faithful wife dies along with her husband. This is called <span class="Italic">saha-mara&#7751;a.</span> In India this system was prevalent even to the date of British occupation. At that time, however, a wife who did not wish to die with her husband was sometimes forced to do so by her relatives. Formerly that was not the case. The wife used to enter the fire voluntarily. The British government stopped this practice, considering it inhuman. However, from the early history of India we find that when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u died, he was survived by two wives&mdash;M&#257;dr&#299; and Kunt&#299;. The question was whether both should die or one should die. After the death of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;u, his wives settled that one should remain and the other should go. M&#257;dr&#299; would perish with her husband in the fire, and Kunt&#299; would remain to take charge of the five P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava children. Even as late as 1936 we saw a devoted wife voluntarily enter the fire of her husband.</div>
<A NAME="63800"></A><div id="63800"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This indicates that a devotee&rsquo;s wife must be prepared to act in such a way. Similarly, a devoted disciple of the spiritual master would rather die with the spiritual master than fail to execute the spiritual master&rsquo;s mission. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes down upon this earth to reestablish the principles of religion, so His representative, the spiritual master, also comes to reestablish religious principles. It is the duty of the disciples to take charge of the mission of the spiritual master and execute it properly. Otherwise the disciple should decide to die along with the spiritual master. In other words, to execute the will of the spiritual master, the disciple should be prepared to lay down his life and abandon all personal considerations.</div>

<div class="First">The appearance of an old friend in the form of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is very significant. In His Param&#257;tm&#257; feature, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the old friend of everyone. According to Vedic injunction, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is sitting with the living entity side by side. According to the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantra</span> (<span class="Italic">dv&#257; supar&#7751;&#257; sayuj&#257; sakh&#257;y&#257;&#7717;</span>), the Lord is sitting within the heart of every living entity as <span class="Italic">suh&#7771;t,</span> the best friend. The Lord is always eager to have the living entity come home, back to Godhead. Sitting with the living entity as witness, the Lord gives him all chances to enjoy himself materially, but whenever there is an opportunity, the Lord gives good counsel and advises the living entity to abandon trying to become happy through material adjustment and instead turn his face toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. When one becomes serious to follow the mission of the spiritual master, his resolution is tantamount to seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained before, this means meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the instruction of the spiritual master. This is technically called <span class="Italic">v&#257;&#7751;&#299;-sev&#257;.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura states in his <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> commentary on the verse <span class="Italic">vyavas&#257;y&#257;tmik&#257; buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/41?d=1">2.41</a>) that one should serve the words of the spiritual master.

<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param&#257;tm&#257;, appeared before the Queen as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> but why didn&rsquo;t He appear in His original form as &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a? &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura remarks that unless one is very highly elevated in loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot see Him as He is. Nonetheless, if one sticks to the principles enunciated by the spiritual master, somehow or other he is in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since the Lord is in the heart, He can advise a sincere disciple from within. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/10/10?d=1">10.10</a>):</div>

Instead of being eager to see the Lord in some bush of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana while at the same time engaging in sense gratification, if one instead sticks to the principle of following the words of the spiritual master, he will see the Supreme Lord without difficulty. &#346;r&#299;la Bilvama&#7749;gala &#7788;h&#257;kura has therefore said:</div>

<div class="First">When a person&rsquo;s relative dies, renunciation is automatically visible. Consultation with the Supersoul seated within everyone&rsquo;s heart is possible only when one is completely free from the contamination of material attachment. One who is sincere and pure gets an opportunity to consult with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Param&#257;tm&#257; feature sitting within everyone&rsquo;s heart. The Param&#257;tm&#257; is always the <span class="Italic">caitya-guru,</span> the spiritual master within, and He comes before one externally as the instructor and initiator spiritual master. The Lord can reside within the heart, and He can also come out before a person and give him instructions. Thus the spiritual master is not different from the Supersoul sitting within the heart. An uncontaminated soul or living entity can get a chance to meet the Param&#257;tm&#257; face to face. Just as one gets a chance to consult with the Param&#257;tm&#257; within his heart, one also gets a chance to see Him actually situated before him. Then one can take instructions from the Supersoul directly. This is the duty of the pure devotee: to see the bona fide spiritual master and consult with the Supersoul within the heart.</div>

<div class="Purport">When the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> asked the woman who the man lying on the floor was, she answered that he was her spiritual master and that she was perplexed about what to do in his absence. At such a time the Supersoul immediately appears, provided the devotee is purified in heart by following the directions of the spiritual master. A sincere devotee who follows the instructions of the spiritual master certainly gets direct instructions from his heart from the Supersoul. Thus a sincere devotee is always helped directly or indirectly by the spiritual master and the Supersoul. This is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta:</span> <span class="Italic">guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja.</span> If the devotee serves his spiritual master sincerely, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a automatically becomes pleased. <span class="Italic">Yasya pras&#257;d&#257;d bhagavad-pras&#257;da&#7717;.</span> By satisfying the spiritual master, one automatically satisfies K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Thus the devotee becomes enriched by both the spiritual master and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The Supersoul is eternally the friend of the living entity and always remains with him. The Supersoul has always been ready to help the living entity, even before the creation of this material world. It is therefore stated here: <span class="Italic">yen&#257;gre vicacartha.</span> The word <span class="Italic">agre</span> means &ldquo;before the creation.&rdquo; Thus the Supersoul has been accompanying the living entity since before the creation.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.&rdquo; This is an explanation of how the living entity falls down into this material world. In the spiritual world there is no duality, nor is there hate. The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself into many. In order to enjoy bliss more and more, the Supreme Lord expands Himself in different categories. As mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> He expands Himself in <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva</span> (the <span class="Italic">sv&#257;&#7745;&#347;a</span> expansion) and in His marginal potency (the <span class="Italic">vibhinn&#257;&#7745;&#347;a,</span> or the living entity). These expanded living entities are innumerable, just as the minute molecules of sunshine are innumerable expansions of the sun. The <span class="Italic">vibhinn&#257;&#7745;&#347;a</span> expansions, the marginal potencies of the Lord, are the living entities. When the living entities desire to enjoy themselves, they develop a consciousness of duality and come to hate the service of the Lord. In this way the living entities fall into the material world. In the <I>P<span class="Italic"></I>rema-vivarta</span> it is said:</div>
<A NAME="63850"></A><div id="63850"> </div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bahirmukha ha�&#257; bhoga-v&#257;�ch&#257; kare<br>nika&#7789;a-stha m&#257;y&#257; t&#257;re j&#257;pa&#7789;iy&#257; dhare</div>
</div><A NAME="63851"></A><div id="63851"> </div>
<div class="After-Verse">The natural position of the living entity is to serve the Lord in a transcendental loving attitude. When the living entity wants to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself or imitate K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, he falls down into the material world. Since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the supreme father, His affection for the living entity is eternal. When the living entity falls down into the material world, the Supreme Lord, through His <span class="Italic">sv&#257;&#7745;&#347;a</span> expansion (Param&#257;tm&#257;), keeps company with the living entity. In this way the living entity may some day return home, back to Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="63852"></A><div id="63852"> </div>
<div class="Purport">By misusing his independence, the living entity falls down from the service of the Lord and takes a position in this material world as an enjoyer. That is to say, the living entity takes his position within a material body. Wanting to take a very exalted position, the living entity instead becomes entangled in a repetition of birth and death. He selects his position as a human being, a demigod, a cat, a dog, a tree, etc. In this way the living entity selects a body out of the 8,400,000 forms and tries to satisfy himself by a variety of material enjoyment. The Supersoul, however, does not like him to do this. Consequently, the Supersoul instructs him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord then takes charge of the living entity. But unless the living entity is uncontaminated by material desires, he cannot surrender to the Supreme Lord. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/5/29?d=1">5.29</a>) the Lord says:</div>

<A NAME="63855"></A><div id="63855"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Lord is the supreme friend of everyone; however, no one can take advantage of the supreme friend&rsquo;s instructions while making his own plans to become happy and entangling himself in the modes of material nature. When there is creation, the living entities take on different forms according to past desires. This means that all the species or forms of life are simultaneously created. Darwin&rsquo;s theory stating that no human being existed from the beginning but that humans evolved after many, many years is simply a nonsensical theory. From Vedic literature we find that the first creature within the universe is Lord Brahm&#257;. Being the most intelligent personality, Lord Brahm&#257; could take charge of creating all the variety found within this material world.</div>

<div class="First">The original home of the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the spiritual world. In the spiritual world both the Lord and the living entities live together very peacefully. Since the living entity remains engaged in the service of the Lord, they both share a blissful life in the spiritual world. However, when the living entity wants to enjoy himself, he falls down into the material world. Even while he is in that position, the Lord remains with him as the Supersoul, his intimate friend. Because of his forgetfulness, the living entity does not know that the Supreme Lord is accompanying him as the Supersoul. In this way the living entity remains conditioned in each and every millennium. Although the Lord follows him as a friend, the living entity, because of forgetful material existence, does not recognize Him.</div>

<div class="First">The living entity enters the material creation with the aid of the five elements&mdash;earth, water, fire, air and ether&mdash;and thus his body is formed. Although the living entity is working from within, he is nonetheless unknown. The living entity enters the material creation, but because he is bewildered by the material energy, he appears to be hidden. The bodily conception of life is prominent because of ignorance (<span class="Italic">n&#257;vabudhyate</span>). Intelligence is described in the feminine gender, but owing to her prominence in all activities, she is described in this verse as <span class="Italic">adh&#299;&#347;a&#7717;,</span> the controller. The living entity lives by means of fire, water and food grains. It is through the combination of these three that the body is maintained. Consequently the body is called <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> material creation. All the elements gradually combine to form flesh, bone, blood and so on. All these appear as various apartments. It is said in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> that the digested foods are ultimately divided into three. The solid portion becomes stool, and the semiliquid portion turns into flesh. The liquid portion turns yellow and is again divided into three. One of these liquid portions is called urine. Similarly, the fiery portion is divided into three, and one is called bone. Out of the five elements, fire, water and food grains are very important.

The Supreme Lord gives these instructions because He is the eternal friend of the living entities. His instructions are important because by them the living entity can obtain liberation from bodily engagement. As water passes down a river, many straws and grasses are carried from the shore. These straws and grasses come together in the river&rsquo;s current, but when the waves toss this way and that, they are separated and carried somewhere else. Similarly, the innumerable living entities within this material world are being carried by the waves of material nature. Sometimes the waves bring them together, and they form friendships and relate to one another on a bodily basis of family, community or nationality. Eventually they are thrown out of association by the waves of material nature. This process has been going on since the creation of material nature. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura sings:</div>

<div class="First">The factual position of both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity is qualitatively one. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme Spirit, the Supersoul, and the living entity is the individual spiritual soul. Even though both of them are original spiritual identities, the living entity forgets his identity when he comes in contact with material nature and becomes conditioned. At such a time he identifies himself as a product of the material nature. Because of the material body, he forgets that he is the eternal (<span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span>) part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in this way: <span class="Italic">mamaiv&#257;&#7745;&#347;o j&#299;va-loke j&#299;va-bh&#363;ta&#7717; san&#257;tana&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/7?d=1">15.7</a></I><span class="Italic">]</I>.</span> The word <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> is found in several places in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> Both the Lord and the living entity are <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana</span> (eternal), and there is also a place known as <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana,</span> beyond this material nature. The real residence of both the living entity and God is the domain of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana,</span> not this material world. The material world is the temporary, external energy of the Lord, and the living entity is placed in this material world because he wanted to imitate the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this material world he tries to enjoy his senses to his best capacity. All the activities of the conditioned soul within this material world are perpetually taking place in different types of bodies, but when the living entity acquires developed consciousness, he should try to rectify his situation and again become a member of the spiritual world. The process by which one can return home, back to Godhead, is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> sometimes called <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma.</span> Instead of accepting a temporary occupational duty based on the material body, one should take to the process of <span class="Italic">san&#257;tana-dharma,</span> or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> so that he can put an end to this perpetual bondage in material bodies and return home, back to Godhead.

<div class="First">Being affected by the conditioning of matter, M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers cannot see the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entity. When the sun is reflected in a pot of water, the sun knows that there is no difference between himself and the reflected sun in the water. Those in ignorance, however, perceive that there are many small suns reflected in each and every pot. As far as the brilliance is concerned, there is brilliance both in the original sun and in the reflections, but the reflections are small, whereas the original sun is very large. Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava philosophers conclude that the living entity is simply a small sample of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Qualitatively, God and the living entities are one, but quantitatively the living entities are small fragments of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is full, powerful and opulent. In the previous verse, the Lord says, &ldquo;My dear friend, you and I are not different.&rdquo; This nondifference refers to qualitative oneness, for it was not necessary for the Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supreme Personality, to remind the conditioned soul that he is not one in quantity. The self-realized soul never thinks that he and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are one in every respect. Although he and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are one in quality, the living entity is prone to forget his spiritual identity, whereas the Supreme Personality never forgets. This is the difference between <span class="Italic">lipta</span> and <span class="Italic">alipta.</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally <span class="Italic">alipta,</span> uncontaminated by the external energy. The conditioned soul, however, being in contact with material nature, forgets his real identity; therefore when he sees himself in the conditioned state, he identifies himself with the body. For the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, there is no difference between the body and the soul. He is completely soul; He has no material body. Although the Supersoul, Param&#257;tm&#257;, and the individual soul are both within the body, the Supersoul is devoid of designation, whereas the conditioned soul is designated by his particular type of body. The Supersoul is called <span class="Italic">antary&#257;m&#299;,</span> and He is extensive. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/13/3?d=1">13.3</a>). <span class="Italic">K&#7779;etraj�a&#7745; c&#257;pi m&#257;&#7745; viddhi sarva-k&#7779;etre&#7779;u bh&#257;rata:</span> &ldquo;O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.&rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="63993"></A><div id="63993"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Supersoul is present in everyone&rsquo;s body, whereas the individual soul is conditioned in one particular type of body. The individual soul cannot understand what is taking place in another&rsquo;s body, but the Supersoul knows very well what is happening in all bodies. In other words, the Supersoul is always present in His full spiritual position, whereas the individual soul is prone to forget himself. Nor is the individual soul present everywhere. Generally in his conditioned state the individual soul cannot understand his relationship with the Supersoul, but sometimes, when he is free from all conditional existence, he can see the real difference between the Supersoul and himself. When the Supersoul tells the conditioned soul, &ldquo;You and I are one and the same,&rdquo; it is to remind the conditioned soul of his spiritual identity as being qualitatively one. In the Third Canto of <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/3/28/40?d=1">3.28.40</a>), it is said:</div>

<div class="First">Here it is clearly stated: <span class="Italic">ha&#7745;so ha&#7745;sena pratibodhita&#7717;.</span> The individual soul and the Supersoul are both compared to swans (<span class="Italic">ha&#7745;sa</span>) because they are white, or uncontaminated. One swan, however, is superior and is the instructor of the other. When the inferior swan is separated from the other swan, he is attracted to material enjoyment. This is the cause of his falldown. When he hears the instructions of the other swan, he understands his real position and is again revived to his original consciousness. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, comes down (<span class="Italic">avat&#257;ra</span>) to deliver His devotees and kill the demons. He also gives His sublime instructions in the form of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> The individual soul has to understand his position by the grace of the Lord and the spiritual master because the text of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> cannot be understood simply by academic qualifications. One has to learn <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> from a realized soul.</div>

<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">tad viddhi pra&#7751;ip&#257;tena<br>paripra&#347;nena sevay&#257;<br>upadek&#7779;yanti te j�&#257;na&#7745;<br>j�&#257;ninas tattva-dar&#347;ina&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="64012"></A><div id="64012"> </div>
<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/34?d=1">4.34</a>)</div>
<A NAME="64013"></A><div id="64013"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Thus one has to select a bona fide spiritual master and become enlightened to his original consciousness. In this way the individual soul can understand that he is always subordinate to the Supersoul. As soon as he declines to remain subordinate and tries to become an enjoyer, he begins his material conditioning. When he abandons this spirit of being an individual owner or enjoyer, he becomes situated in his liberated state. The word <span class="Italic">sva-stha&#7717;,</span> meaning &ldquo;situated in one&rsquo;s original position,&rdquo; is very significant in this verse. When one gives up his unwanted attitude of superiority, he becomes situated in his original position. The word <span class="Italic">tad-vyabhic&#257;re&#7751;a</span> is also significant, for it indicates that when one is separated from God due to disobedience, his real sense is lost. Again, by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and <span class="Italic">guru,</span> he can be properly situated in his liberated position. These verses are spoken by &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada Muni, and his purpose in speaking them is to revive our consciousness. Although the living entity and the Supersoul are one in quality, the individual soul has to pursue the instruction of the Supersoul. That is the state of liberation.</div>

<div class="First">There are many similar stories in the <span class="Italic">pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> for self-realization. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas:</span> <span class="Italic">parok&#7779;a-priy&#257; iva hi dev&#257;&#7717;.</span> There are many stories in the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> that are intended to interest ordinary men in transcendental subjects, but actually these refer to real facts. They are not to be considered stories without a transcendental purpose. Some of them refer to real historical facts. One should be interested, however, in the real purport of the story. Indirect instruction is quickly understandable for a common man. Factually the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the path of hearing directly about the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; </I>[SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/23-24?d=1">7.5.23</a>]), but those who are not interested in hearing directly about the activities of the Lord, or who cannot understand them, can very effectively hear such stories and fables as this one narrated by N&#257;rada Muni.</div>
