<div class="First">Real opulence is supplied by natural gifts such as gold, silver, pearls, valuable stones, fresh flowers, trees and silken cloth. Thus the Vedic civilization recommends opulence and decoration with these natural gifts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such opulence immediately changes the condition of the mind, and the entire atmosphere becomes spiritualized. King P&#7771;thu&rsquo;s capital was decorated with such highly opulent decorations.</div>

Similarly, a welcome offered by unmarried girls who are internally and externally clean and are dressed in nice garments and ornaments is also auspicious. <span class="Italic">Kum&#257;r&#299;,</span> or unmarried girls untouched by the hand of any member of the opposite sex, are auspicious members of society. Even today in Hindu society the most conservative families do not allow unmarried girls to go out freely or mix with boys. They are very carefully protected by their parents while unmarried, after marriage they are protected by their young husbands, and when elderly they are protected by their children. When thus protected, women as a class remain an always auspicious source of energy to man.</div>

This is a sign of the wonderful character of great personalities.</div>

In a responsible monarchy the citizens had no grievances against the government, and even if they did, they could approach the king directly for immediate satisfaction.</div>

Similarly, <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> can discharge their respective duties perfectly and thus at the ultimate end of life be promoted to the transcendental world, which is called <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam.</span> <span class="Italic">Para&#7745; padam,</span> or the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets, can be achieved only by devotional service. The impersonal Brahman region is also called <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam,</span> but unless one is attached to the personality of Godhead one must again fall down to the material world from the impersonal <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam</span> situation. It is said, therefore, <span class="Italic">&#257;ruhya k&#7771;cchre&#7751;a para&#7745; pada&#7745; tata&#7717;:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/10/2/32?d=1">10.2.32</a>] the impersonalists endeavor very strenuously to achieve the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam,</span> or impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> but unfortunately, being bereft of a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they come down again to the material world. If one flies in outer space, he can go very high up, but unless he reaches a planet he must come down again to earth. Similarly, because the impersonalists who reach the <span class="Italic">para&#7745; padam</span> of the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> do not enter into the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets, they come down again to this material world and are given shelter in one of the material planets. Although they may attain Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, all such planets are situated in the material world.</div>

Thus blessed by them, he ruled over the earth and exploited its resources for the greatest satisfaction of the people in general. This has already been explained in the previous chapters regarding the activities of King P&#7771;thu.

Regardless of whether the chief executive is a king or president, or whether the government is monarchical or democratic, this process is so perfect that if it is followed, everyone will become happy, and thus it will be very easy for all to execute devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">The terms &ldquo;pious&rdquo; and &ldquo;impious&rdquo; are applicable only in reference to the activities of an ordinary living being. But Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu was a directly empowered incarnation of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; therefore he was not subject to the reactions of pious or impious activities. As we have already explained previously, when a living being is specifically empowered by the Supreme Lord to act for a particular purpose, he is called a <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a-avat&#257;ra.</span> P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was not only a <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a-avat&#257;ra</span> but also a great devotee. A devotee is not subjected to the reactions resulting from past deeds. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">karm&#257;&#7751;i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh&#257;j&#257;m:</I> [Bs. </span></I>5.54</I>]</I> for devotees the results of past pious and impious activities are nullified by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words <span class="Italic">&#257;rabdh&#257;n eva</span> mean &ldquo;as if achieved by past deeds,&rdquo; but in the case of P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja there was no question of reaction to past deeds, and thus the word <span class="Italic">eva</span> is used here to indicate comparison to ordinary persons. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord says, <span class="Italic">avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;&#7745; m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717;.</span> This means that sometimes people misunderstand an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be an ordinary man. The Supreme Godhead, His incarnations or His devotees may pose themselves as ordinary men, but they are never to be considered as such. Nor should an ordinary man not supported by authorized statements of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> be accepted as an incarnation or devotee. By the evidence of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; detected Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu to be a direct incarnation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although Lord Caitanya never disclosed the fact. It is therefore generally recommended that the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> or <span class="Italic">guru,</span> should not be accepted as an ordinary man.</div>

The country where P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja resided must have been India because it is stated in the eleventh verse of this chapter that he lived in the tract of land between the rivers Ganges and Yamun&#257;. This tract of land, which is called Brahm&#257;varta, consists of what is known in the modern age as portions of Punjab and northern India.

<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">askhalita</span> indicates that orders by the king could not be disobeyed by anyone in the entire world. Such orders, however, were never issued to control saintly persons or the descendants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The Supreme Lord is known as Acyuta, and Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is addressed as such by Arjuna in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">senayor ubhayor madhye ratha&#7745; sth&#257;paya me &rsquo;cyuta</span>). <span class="Italic">Acyuta</span> refers to one who does not fall because He is never influenced by the modes of material nature. When a living entity falls down to the material world from his original position, he becomes <span class="Italic">cyuta,</span> which means that he forgets his relationship with Acyuta. Actually every living entity is a part and parcel, or a son, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When influenced by the modes of material nature, a living entity forgets this relationship and thinks in terms of different species of life; but when he again comes to his original consciousness, he does not observe such bodily designations. This is indicated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/5/18?d=1">5.18</a>) by the words <span class="Italic">pa&#7751;&#7693;it&#257;&#7717; sama-dar&#347;ina&#7717;.</span></div>

<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhava&#7717;</span> (&ldquo;all great souls&rdquo;) is very significant. When a person is very great and famous, many unscrupulous persons become his enemies, for envy is the nature of materialists. In any meeting there are different classes of men, and it is to be supposed, therefore, that because P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was very great, he must have had several enemies present in the assembly, although they could not express themselves. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, however, was concerned with persons who were gentle, and therefore he first addressed all the honest persons, not caring for the envious. He did not, however, present himself as a royal authority empowered to command everyone, for he wanted to present his statement in humble submission before the assembly of great sages and saintly persons. As a great king of the entire world, he could have given them orders, but he was so humble, meek and honest that he presented his statement for approval in order to clarify his mature decision. Everyone within this material world is conditioned by the modes of material nature and therefore has four defects. But although P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was above all these, still, like an ordinary conditioned soul, he presented his statements to the great souls, sages and saintly persons present there.</div>

<div class="First">A king is supposed to be appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to look after the interests of his particular planet. On every planet there is a predominating person, just as we now see that in every country there is a president. If one is president or king, it should be understood that this opportunity has been given to him by the Supreme Lord. According to the Vedic system, the king is considered a representative of Godhead and is offered respects by the citizens as God in the human form of life. Actually, according to Vedic information, the Supreme Lord maintains all living entities, and especially human beings, to elevate them to the highest perfection. After many, many births in lower species, when a living entity evolves to the human form of life and in particular to the civilized human form of life, his society must be divided into four gradations, as ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">c&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya&#7745; may&#257; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;am,</span> etc.</I><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/13?d=1">4.13</a>]). The four social orders&mdash;the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span>&mdash;are natural divisions of human society, and as declared by P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, every man in his respective social order must have proper employment for his livelihood. It is the duty of the king or the government to insure that the people observe the social order and that they are also employed in their respective occupational duties. In modern times, since the protection of the government or the king has been withdrawn, social order has practically collapsed. No one knows who is a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> who is a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> who is a <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> or who is a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> and people claim to belong to a particular social order by birthright only. It is the duty of the government to reestablish social order in terms of occupational duties and the modes of material nature, for that will make the entire world population actually civilized. If it does not observe the institutional functions of the four social orders, human society is no better than animal society in which there is never tranquillity, peace and prosperity but only chaos and confusion. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, as an ideal king, strictly observed the maintenance of the Vedic social order.</div>

<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">Praj&#257;yate iti praj&#257;.</span> The word <span class="Italic">praj&#257;</span> refers to one who takes birth.

It is the duty of the king to give all living entities protection and food. The fools and rascals of modern society have no knowledge of the extent of the responsibility of the government. Animals are also citizens of the land in which they happen to be born, and they also have the right to continue their existence at the cost of the Supreme Lord. The disturbance of the animal population by wholesale slaughter produces a catastrophic future reaction for the butcher, his land and his government.</div>

Transcendental sound is not ordinary language, although it appears to be written in ordinary language. Evidence from the Vedic literature should be accepted as final authority. In the Vedic literature there is much information, and of course there is information about the execution of a king&rsquo;s duty. A responsible king who executes his appointed duty by giving proper protection to all living entities on his planet is promoted to the heavenly planetary system. This is also dependent upon the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. It is not that if one executes his duty properly he is automatically promoted, for promotion depends upon the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It must ultimately be concluded that one can achieve the desired result of his activities upon satisfying the Supreme Lord.

<div class="After-Verse">The perfection of one&rsquo;s execution of his appointed duties is the ultimate satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. The word <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma-sandoh&#257;&#7717;</span> means &ldquo;achievement of the desired result.&rdquo; Everyone desires to achieve the ultimate goal of life, but in modern civilization the great scientists think that man&rsquo;s life has no plan. This gross ignorance is very dangerous and makes civilization very risky. People do not know the laws of nature, which are the rulings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are atheists of the first order, they have no faith in the existence of God and His rulings and therefore do not know how nature is working. This gross ignorance of the mass of people, including even the so-called scientists and philosophers, makes life a risky situation in which human beings do not know whether they are making progress in life. According to <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/30?d=1">7.5.30</a>), they are simply progressing to the darkest region of material existence. <span class="Italic">Ad&#257;nta-gobhir vi&#347;at&#257;&#7745; tamisram.</span> The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has therefore been started to give philosophers, scientists, and people in general the proper knowledge about the destiny of life. Everyone should take advantage of this movement and learn the real goal of life.</div>

The laws of nature are very subtle. For example, if one eats in a place which is very sinful, he shares in the resultant reaction of the sinful activities performed there. (It is a Vedic system, therefore, for a householder to call <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas to eat at ceremonial performances in his house because the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas can immunize him from sinful activities.

The king and citizens should both be K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, otherwise both of them will be doomed to lower species of life after death. A responsible government must teach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness very vigorously for the benefit of all. Without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, neither the state nor the citizens of the state can be responsible. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore specifically requested the citizens to act in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, and he was also very anxious to teach them how to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious.

<div class="First">The government of P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was perfect because it was administered exactly according to the orders of the Vedic injunctions. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has already explained that the chief duty of the government is to see that everyone executes his respective duty and is elevated to the platform of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. The government should be so conducted that automatically one is elevated to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. King P&#7771;thu therefore wanted his citizens to cooperate fully with him, for if they assented, they would enjoy the same profit as he after death. If P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, as a perfect king, were elevated to the heavenly planets, the citizens who cooperated by approving of his methods would also be elevated with him. Since the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement going on at the present moment is genuine, perfect and authorized and is following in the footsteps of P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, anyone who cooperates with this movement or accepts its principles will get the same result as the workers who are actively propagating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s sole aim in ruling his kingdom was to raise the citizens to the standard of God consciousness. Since there was a great assembly in the arena of sacrifice, there were different types of men present, but he was especially interested in speaking to those who were not atheists. It has already been explained in the previous verses that P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja advised the citizens to become <span class="Italic">adhok&#7779;aja-dhiya&#7717;,</span> which means God conscious, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, and in this verse he specifically presents the authority of <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra,</span> even though his father was a number one atheist who did not abide by the injunctions mentioned in the Vedic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> who practically stopped all sacrificial performances and who so disgusted the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> that they not only dethroned him but cursed and killed him. Atheistic men do not believe in the existence of God, and thus they understand everything which is happening in our daily affairs to be due to physical arrangement and chance. Atheists believe in the atheistic S&#257;&#7749;khya philosophy of the combination of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> and <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a.</span> They believe only in matter and hold that matter under certain conditions of amalgamation gives rise to the living force, which then appears as <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> the enjoyer; then, by a combination of matter and the living force, the many varieties of material manifestation come into existence. Nor do atheists believe in the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> According to them, all the Vedic injunctions are simply theories that have no practical application in life. Taking all this into consideration, P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja suggested that theistic men will solidly reject the views of the atheists on the grounds that there cannot be many varieties of existence without the plan of a superior intelligence. Atheists very vaguely explain that these varieties of existence occur simply by chance, but the theists who believe in the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> must reach all their conclusions under the direction of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<A NAME="58346"></A><div id="58346"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> it is said that the entire <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The rules and regulations set up for the execution of the duties of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> or <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, g&#7771;hasthas, v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> are all meant to satisfy the Supreme Lord. At the present moment, although the so-called <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> have lost their original culture, they claim to be <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> by birthright. Yet they have rejected the proposition that such social and spiritual orders are especially meant for worship of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The dangerous M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da theory set forth by &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya&mdash;that God is impersonal&mdash;does not tally with the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore described the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers as the greatest offenders against the Personality of Godhead. According to the Vedic system, one who does not abide by the orders of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is called a <span class="Italic">n&#257;stika,</span> or atheist. When Lord Buddha preached his theory of nonviolence, he was obliged to deny the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and for this reason he was considered by the followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> to be a <span class="Italic">n&#257;stika.</span> But although &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu very clearly enunciated that the followers of Lord Buddha&rsquo;s philosophy are <span class="Italic">n&#257;stikas,</span> or atheists, because of their denial of the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> He considered the &#346;a&#7749;karites, who wanted to establish Vedic authority by trickery and who actually followed the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy of Buddha&rsquo;s school, to be more dangerous than the Buddhists themselves. The &#346;a&#7749;karite philosophers&rsquo; theory that we have to imagine a shape of God is more dangerous than denial of the existence of God. Notwithstanding all the philosophical theorizing by atheists or M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, the followers of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness rigidly live according to the injunctions given in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> which is accepted as the essence of all Vedic scripture. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/46?d=1">18.46</a>) it is said:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection.&rdquo; This indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of everything, as described in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> (<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I>).

The Absolute Truth is therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and every living being is meant to satisfy the Supreme Godhead by performing his respective duty (<span class="Italic">sva-karma&#7751;&#257; tam abhyarcya</span>). Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu wanted to introduce this formula amongst his citizens.</div>

<div class="Purport">The most important point in human civilization is that while one engages in different occupational duties, he must try to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the execution of such duties. That is the highest perfection of life. <span class="Italic">Svanu&#7779;&#7789;hitasya dharmasya sa&#7745;siddhir hari-to&#7779;a&#7751;am:</I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/13?d=1">1.2.13</a></I>]</span></I> by discharging one&rsquo;s prescribed duty, one can become very successful in life if he simply satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The vivid example is Arjuna. He was a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> his duty was to fight, and by executing his prescribed duty he satisfied the Supreme Lord and therefore became perfect. Everyone should follow this principle. The atheists, who do not, are condemned in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/16/19?d=1">16.19</a>) by the following statement: <span class="Italic">t&#257;n aha&#7745; dvi&#7779;ata&#7717; kr&#363;r&#257;n sa&#7745;s&#257;re&#7779;u nar&#257;dham&#257;n.</span> In this verse it is clearly said that persons who are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the lowest of mankind and are very mischievous. Under the regulative principles of the Supreme, such mischievous persons are thrown into the darkest region of material existence and are born of <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or atheists. Birth after birth, such <span class="Italic">asuras</span> go still further down, finally to animal forms like those of tigers or similar ferocious beasts. Thus for millions of years they have to remain in darkness without knowledge of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<A NAME="58350"></A><div id="58350"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Puru&#7779;ottama, or the best of all living entities. He is a person like all other living entities, but He is the leader or the best of all living beings. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also. <span class="Italic">Nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m.</span> He is the chief of all eternals, the chief of all living entities, and He is complete and full. He has no need to derive benefit by interfering with the affairs of other living entities, but because He is the maintainer of all, He has the right to bring them to the proper standard so that all living entities may become happy. A father wants all of his children to become happy under his direction. Similarly, God, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has the right to see that all living entities are happy. There is no possibility of becoming happy within this material world. The father and the sons are eternal, but if a living entity does not come to the platform of his eternal life of bliss and knowledge, there is no question of happiness. Although Puru&#7779;ottama, the best of all living entities, has no benefit to derive from the common living entities, He does have the right to discriminate between their right and wrong ways. The right way is the path of activities meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as we have already discussed (<span class="Italic">svanu&#7779;&#7789;hitasya dharmasya sa&#7745;siddhir hari-to&#7779;a&#7751;am</I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/13?d=1">1.2.13</a></I>]</span></I>). A living entity may engage in any occupational duty, but if he wants to have perfection in his duties, he must satisfy the Supreme Lord. As such, one who pleases Him gets better facilities for living, but one who displeases Him gets involved in undesirable situations.</div>
<A NAME="58351"></A><div id="58351"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is therefore concluded that there are two kinds of duties&mdash;mundane duty and duty performed for the sake of <span class="Italic">yaj�a,</span> or sacrifice (<span class="Italic">yaj�&#257;rth&#257;t karma</span>). Any <span class="Italic">karma</span> (activity) one performs which is not for the purpose of <span class="Italic">yaj�a</span> is a cause of bondage. <span class="Italic">Yaj�&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o&rsquo;nyatra loko&rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;Work done as a sacrifice for Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/9?d=1">3.9</a>) <span class="Italic">Karma-bandhana&#7717;,</span> or the bondage of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> is administered under the regulations of the stringent laws of material nature. Material existence is a struggle to conquer the impediments put forth by material nature. The <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are always fighting to overcome these impediments, and by the illusory power of material nature the foolish living entities work very hard within this material world and take this to be happiness. This is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> In that hard struggle for existence, they deny the existence of the supreme authority, Puru&#7779;ottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="58352"></A><div id="58352"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In order to regulate the activities of the living entities, God has given us codes, just as a king gives codes of law in a state, and whoever breaks the law is punished. Similarly, the Lord has given the infallible knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> which are not contaminated by the four defects of human life&mdash;namely the tendency to commit mistakes, to be illusioned, to cheat and to have imperfect senses. If we do not take direction from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> but act whimsically according to our own choice, we are sure to be punished by the laws of the Lord, who offers different types of bodies in the 8,400,000 species of forms. Material existence, or the sense gratification process, is conducted according to the type of body we are given by <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or material nature. As such, there must be divisions of pious and impious activities (<span class="Italic">pu&#7751;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">p&#257;pa</span>). In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/28?d=1">7.28</a>) it is clearly stated:</div>

<A NAME="58355"></A><div id="58355"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The different varieties of life and of material existence do not come about by chance and necessity; they are different arrangements made by the Supreme Lord in terms of the pious and impious activities of the living entities. By performing pious activities one can take birth in a good family in a good nation, one can get a beautiful body or can become very well educated or very rich. We see, therefore, that in different places and in different planets there are different standards of life, bodily features and educational statuses, all awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to pious or impious activities. Varieties of life, therefore, develop not by chance but by prearrangement. There is a plan, which is already outlined in the Vedic knowledge. One has to take advantage of this knowledge and mold his life in such a way that at the end, especially in the human form of life, he may go back home, back to Godhead, by practicing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>
<A NAME="58356"></A><div id="58356"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The theory of chance can best be explained in the Vedic literature by the words <span class="Italic">aj�&#257;ta-suk&#7771;ti,</span> which refer to pious activities performed without the actor&rsquo;s knowledge. But these are also planned. For example, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a comes like an ordinary human being, He comes as a devotee like Lord Caitanya, or He sends His representative, the spiritual master, or pure devotee. This is also the planned activity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They come to canvass and educate, and thus a person in the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord gets a chance to mix with them, talk with them and take lessons from them, and somehow or other if a conditioned soul surrenders to such personalities and by intimate association with them chances to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, he is saved from the material conditions of life.

<div class="First">King Vena, the father of P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, was condemned by the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and saintly persons because of his denying the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and rejecting the method of satisfying Him by performance of Vedic sacrifice. In other words, he was an atheist, who did not believe in the existence of God, and who consequently stopped all Vedic ritualistic ceremonies in his kingdom. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja considered King Vena&rsquo;s character abominable because Vena was foolish regarding the execution of religious performances. Atheists are of the opinion that there is no need to accept the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be successful in religion, economic development, sense gratification or liberation. According to them, <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or religious principles, are meant to establish an imaginary God to encourage one to become moral, honest and just so that the social orders may be maintained in peace and tranquillity. Furthermore, they say that actually there is no need to accept God for this purpose, for if one follows the principles of morality and honesty, that is sufficient. Similarly, if one makes nice plans and works very hard for economic development, automatically the result of economic development will come. Similarly, sense gratification also does not depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for if one earns enough money by any process, one will have sufficient opportunity for sense gratification. Insofar as liberation is concerned, they say that there is no need to talk of liberation because after death everything is finished. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, did not accept the authority of such atheists, headed by his father, who was the grandson of death personified. Generally, a daughter inherits the qualities of her father, and a son gets the qualities of his mother. Thus M&#7771;tyu&rsquo;s daughter, Sun&#299;th&#257;, got all the qualities of her father, and Vena inherited the qualities of his mother. A person who is always subjected to the rules and regulations of repeated birth and death cannot accommodate anything beyond materialistic ideas. Since King Vena was such a man, he did not believe in the existence of God. Modern civilization agrees with the principles of King Vena, but factually if we scrutinizingly study all the conditions of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, we must accept the principles of the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Vedic literature, religion consists only of the codes of law given by God.</div>
<A NAME="58389"></A><div id="58389"> </div>
<div class="Purport">If one does not accept the authority of the Supreme Godhead in matters of religion and morality, one must explain why two persons of the same moral standard achieve different results. It is generally found that even if two men have the same moral standards of ethics, honesty and morality, their positions are still not the same. Similarly, in economic development it is seen that if two men work very hard day and night, still the results are not the same. One person may enjoy great opulence without even working, whereas another person, although working very hard, does not even get two sufficient meals a day. Similarly, in the matter of sense gratification, sometimes one who has sufficient food is still not happy in his family affairs or sometimes is not even married, whereas another person, even though not economically well off, has the greatest opportunity for sense gratification. Even an animal like a hog or a dog may have greater opportunities for sense gratification than a human being. Aside from liberation, even if we consider only the preliminary necessities of life&mdash;<span class="Italic">dharma, artha</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> (religion, economic development and sense gratification)&mdash;we will see that they are not the same for everyone. Therefore it must be accepted that there is someone who determines the different standards. In conclusion, not only for liberation must one depend on the Lord, but even for ordinary necessities in this material world. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore indicated that in spite of having rich parents, children are sometimes not happy. Similarly, in spite of valuable medicine administered by a competent physician, sometimes a patient dies; or in spite of having a big safe boat, sometimes a man drowns. We may thus struggle to counteract impediments offered by material nature, but our attempts cannot be successful unless we are favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">By the inclination to serve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, suffering humanity can immediately cleanse the dirt which has accumulated in their minds during innumerable births. Like the Ganges water, which emanates from the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, such a process immediately cleanses the mind, and thus spiritual or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness gradually increases.</div>

<div class="First">In India, one can actually see that a person who takes a bath in the Ganges waters daily is almost free from all kinds of diseases. A very respectable <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> in Calcutta never took a doctor&rsquo;s medicine. Even though he sometimes felt sick, he would not accept medicine from the physician but would simply drink Ganges water, and he was always cured within a very short time. The glories of Ganges water are known to Indians and to ourselves also. The River Ganges flows by Calcutta. Sometimes within the water there are many stools and other dirty things which are washed away from neighboring mills and factories, but still thousands of men take baths in the Ganges water, and they are very healthy as well as spiritually inclined. That is the effect of Ganges water. The Ganges is glorified because it emanates from the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, if one takes to the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, or takes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he is immediately cleansed of the many dirty things which have accumulated in his innumerable births. We have seen that in spite of the very black record of their past lives, persons who take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness become perfectly cleansed of all dirty things and make spiritual progress very swiftly. Therefore P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja advises that without the benediction of the Supreme Lord, one cannot make advancement&mdash;either in so-called morality, economic development or sense gratification. One should therefore take to the service of the Lord, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, and thus very soon become a perfect man, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">k&#7779;ipra&#7745; bhavati dharm&#257;tm&#257; &#347;a&#347;vac ch&#257;nti&#7745; nigacchati</span>). Being a responsible king, P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja recommends that everyone take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus be immediately purified. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that simply by surrendering unto Him one is immediately relieved of all sinful reactions. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a takes away all the sinful reactions of a person immediately upon his surrender unto Him, similarly the external manifestation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the representative of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a who acts as the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple immediately after the disciple&rsquo;s initiation. Thus if the disciple follows the principles instructed by the spiritual master, he remains purified and is not contaminated by the material infection.</div>
<A NAME="58403"></A><div id="58403"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore stated that the spiritual master who plays the part of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s representative has to consume all the sinful reactions of his disciple. Sometimes a spiritual master takes the risk of being overwhelmed by the sinful reactions of the disciples and undergoes a sort of tribulation due to their acceptance. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore advised that one not accept many disciples.</div>

The understanding of the distinction between material existence and spiritual existence is called <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na.</span> After coming to the platform of <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na,</span> or the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> state, one ultimately comes to devotional service, in which he completely understands his own position and the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This understanding is explained here as <span class="Italic">vij�&#257;na-vi&#347;e&#7779;a.</span> The Lord says, therefore, that knowledge of Him is <span class="Italic">vij�&#257;na,</span> science. In other words, when one is strengthened by scientific knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his position of liberation is guaranteed. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/2?d=1">9.2</a>), the science of devotional service is described as <span class="Italic">pratyak&#7779;&#257;vagama&#7745; dharmyam,</span> direct understanding of the principles of religion by realization.</div>

<div class="Purport">By practicing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one can directly perceive his advancement in spiritual life. In other practices&mdash;like <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, j�&#257;na-yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">dhy&#257;na-yoga</span>&mdash;one may not be confident about his progress, but in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> one can become directly aware of his progress in spiritual life, just as a person who eats can understand that his hunger is satisfied. Our false appetite for enjoyment and lordship of the material world is due to a prominence of passion and ignorance. By <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> these two qualities are diminished, and one becomes situated in the mode of goodness. Gradually surpassing the mode of goodness, one is situated in pure goodness, which is not contaminated by the material qualities. When thus situated, a devotee no longer has any doubts; he knows that he will not come back to this material world.</div>

<div class="First">As stated in the Eighteenth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">sva-karma&#7751;&#257; tam abhyarcya:</span> one has to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one&rsquo;s occupational duties. This necessitates accepting the principle of four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore says, <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;ai&#7717; sva-karmabhi&#7717;.</span> This phrase is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">C&#257;tur-var&#7751;ya&#7745; may&#257; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; gu&#7751;a-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;The four castes (the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span>) are created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the material modes of nature and the particular duties discharged in those modes.&rdquo; A person who is situated in the mode of goodness is certainly more intelligent than others. Therefore he can practice the brahminical activities&mdash;namely speaking the truth, controlling the senses, controlling the mind, remaining always clean, practicing tolerance, having full knowledge about one&rsquo;s self-identity, and understanding devotional service. In this way, if he engages himself in the loving service of the Lord as an actual <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> his aim to achieve the final interest of life is attained. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya&rsquo;s</span> duties are to give protection to the citizens, to give all his possessions in charity, to be strictly Vedic in the management of state affairs and to be unafraid to fight whenever there is an attack by enemies. In this way, a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his occupational duties. Similarly, a <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> can satisfy the Supreme Godhead by properly executing his occupational duties&mdash;engaging himself in producing foodstuffs, giving protection to cows, and trading if necessary when there is an excess of agricultural production. Similarly, because <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> do not have ample intelligence, they should simply engage as workers to serve the higher statuses of social life. Everyone&rsquo;s aim should be to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by engaging his mind in thinking always of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his words in always offering prayers to the Lord or preaching about the glories of the Lord, and his body in executing the service required to satisfy the Lord. As there are four divisions within our body&mdash;the head, the arms, the belly and the legs&mdash;similarly, human society, taken as a whole, is divided into four classes of men according to their material qualities and occupational duties. Thus the brahminical or intelligent men have to execute the duty of the head, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> must fulfill the duty of the arms, the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> class must fulfill the duty of the belly, and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> must fulfill the duty of the legs. In executing the prescribed duties of life, no one is higher or lower; there are such divisions as &ldquo;higher&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower,&rdquo; but since there is actually a common interest&mdash;to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead&mdash;there are no distinctions between them.</div>
<A NAME="58433"></A><div id="58433"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The question may be raised that since the Lord is supposed to be worshiped by great demigods like Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and others, how can an ordinary human being on this planet serve Him? This is clearly explained by P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja by the use of the word <span class="Italic">yath&#257;dhik&#257;ra,</span> &ldquo;according to one&rsquo;s ability.&rdquo; If one sincerely executes his occupational duty, that will be sufficient. One does not need to become like Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva, Indra, Lord Caitanya or R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;c&#257;rya, whose capabilities are certainly far above ours. Even a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> who is in the lowest stage of life according to the material qualities, can achieve the same success. Anyone can become successful in devotional service provided he displays no duplicity. It is explained here that one must be very frank and open-minded (<span class="Italic">am&#257;yina&#7717;</span>). To be situated in a lower status of life is not a disqualification for success in devotional service. The only qualification is that whether one is a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> or <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> he must be open, frank and free from reservations. Then, by performing his particular occupational duty under the guidance of a proper spiritual master, he can achieve the highest success in life. As confirmed by the Lord Himself, <span class="Italic">striyo vai&#347;y&#257;s tath&#257; &#347;&#363;dr&#257;s te &rsquo;pi y&#257;nti par&#257;&#7745; gatim</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/32?d=1">9.32</a>). It does not matter what one is, whether a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya, &#347;&#363;dra</span> or a degraded woman. If one engages himself seriously in devotional service, working with body, mind and intelligence, he is sure to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead. The Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet are described here as <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma-dugh&#257;&#7749;ghri-pa&#7749;kajam</span> because they have all power to fulfill the desires of everyone. A devotee is happy even in this life because although in material existence we have many needs, all his material needs are satisfied, and when he at last quits his body, he goes back home, back to Godhead, without a doubt.</div>

<div class="First">For material prosperity there are recommendations in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> for various types of <span class="Italic">yaj�a</span> (sacrifice). In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/10?d=1">3.10</a>) it is confirmed that Lord Brahm&#257; created all living entities, including human beings and demigods, and advised them to perform <span class="Italic">yaj�a</span> according to their material desires (<span class="Italic">saha-yaj�&#257;&#7717; praj&#257;&#7717; s&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;v&#257;</span>). These performances are called <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> because their ultimate goal is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The purpose of performing <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> is to get material benefit, but because the aim is to simultaneously satisfy the Supreme Lord, such <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> have been recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Such performances are, of course, known as <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> or material activities, and all material activities are certainly contaminated by the three modes of material nature. Generally the <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> ritualistic ceremonies are performed in the mode of passion, yet the conditioned souls, both human beings and demigods, are obliged to perform these <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> because without them one cannot be happy at all.</div>

<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura comments that these <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> ritualistic ceremonies, although contaminated, contain touches of devotional service because whenever there is a performance of any <span class="Italic">yaj�a,</span> Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is given a central position. This is very important because even a little endeavor to please Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and is of great value. A tinge of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> purifies the material nature of the performances, which by devotional service gradually come to the transcendental position. Therefore although such <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> are superficially material activities, the results are transcendental. Such <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> as S&#363;rya-yaj�a, Indra-yaj�a and Candra-yaj�a are performed in the names of the demigods, but these demigods are bodily parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods cannot accept sacrificial offerings for themselves, but they can accept them for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as a departmental tax collector of a government cannot collect taxes for his personal account but can realize them for the government. Any <span class="Italic">yaj�a</span> performed with this complete knowledge and understanding is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;rpa&#7751;am,</span> or a sacrifice offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since no one but the Supreme Lord can enjoy the results of sacrifice, the Lord says that He is the actual enjoyer of all sacrifices (<span class="Italic">bhokt&#257;ra&#7745; yaj�a-tapas&#257;&#7745; sarva-loka-mahe&#347;varam </I>[Bg.</I> </span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/5/29?d=1">5.29</a>]).

<div class="After-Verse">This ninefold process is described in this verse as <span class="Italic">vi&#347;uddha-vij�&#257;na-ghana&#7717;,</span> or satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly by transcendental knowledge concentrated on the form of the Supreme Lord, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. This is the best method for satisfying the Supreme Lord. One who cannot take to this direct process, however, should take the indirect process of performing <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> for the satisfaction of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or Yaj�a. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is therefore called <span class="Italic">yaj�a-pati.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;ya&#7717; pati&#7745; yaj�a-pati&#7745; jagat-patim</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/9/15?d=1">2.9.15</a>).</div>

<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead&rsquo;s deep scientific knowledge is concentrated to the supreme point. For example, medical science knows some things superficially, but doctors do not know exactly how things happen in the body. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, however, knows everything in detail. Therefore His knowledge is <span class="Italic">vij�&#257;na-ghana</span> because it does not have any of the defects of material science. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">vi&#347;uddha-vij�&#257;na-ghana,</span> concentrated transcendental knowledge; therefore, even though He accepts <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya</span> materialistic <span class="Italic">yaj�as,</span> He always remains in a transcendental position. Therefore, the mention of <span class="Italic">aneka-gu&#7751;a</span> refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead&rsquo;s many transcendental qualities, for He is not affected by the material qualities. The different kinds of material paraphernalia or physical elements are also gradually transformed into spiritual understanding because ultimately there is no difference between material and spiritual qualities, for everything emanates from the Supreme Spirit. This is realized by a gradual process of realization and purification. One vivid example of this is Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, who took to meditation in the forest to achieve material benefit but ultimately became spiritually advanced and did not want any benediction for material profit. He was simply satisfied with the association of the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">&#256;&#347;aya</span> means &ldquo;determination.&rdquo; Generally a conditioned soul has the determination for material profit, but when these desires for material profit are satisfied through performance of <span class="Italic">yaj�a,</span> one gradually achieves the spiritual platform. Then his life becomes perfect. <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/2/3/10?d=1">2.3.10</a>) therefore recommends:</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-pervading, but He is also manifested in different types of bodies which arise from a combination of material nature, time, desires and occupational duties.

<div class="First">The Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly lives with the individual soul as Param&#257;tm&#257;. The individual soul has awareness in accord with his material body, which he attains by virtue of <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or material nature. The material ingredients are activated by the force of time, and thus the three material modes of nature are manifested. According to his association with the three modes of nature, the living entity develops a particular type of body. In animal life, the material mode of ignorance is so prominent that there is very little chance of realizing the Param&#257;tm&#257;, who is also present within the heart of the animal; but in the human form of life, because of developed consciousness (<span class="Italic">cetan&#257;m</span>), one can be transferred from ignorance and passion to goodness by the results of his activities (<span class="Italic">kriy&#257;-phalatvena</span>). A human being is therefore advised to associate with spiritually advanced personalities.

It is imperative that one approach the spiritual master, for by such association one proportionately develops his consciousness toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The highest perfection of such consciousness is called K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. According to the body given by <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> or nature, one&rsquo;s consciousness is present; according to the development of consciousness, one&rsquo;s activities are performed; and according to the purity of such activities, one realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone&rsquo;s heart. The example given herein is very appropriate. Fire is always the same, but according to the size of the fuel or burning wood, the fire appears to be straight, curved, small, big, etc.</div>

<div class="Purport">According to the development of consciousness, God realization is present. In the human form of life it is recommended, therefore, that one undergo the different types of penances and austerities described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">karma-yoga, j�&#257;na-yoga, dhy&#257;na-yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span>). Like a staircase, <span class="Italic">yoga</span> has different steps for reaching the topmost floor, and according to one&rsquo;s position upon the staircase, he is understood to be situated in <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, j�&#257;na-yoga, dhy&#257;na-yoga</span> or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Of course, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the topmost step on the staircase of realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, according to one&rsquo;s development in consciousness, one realizes his spiritual identity, and thus when one&rsquo;s existential position is purified fully, he becomes situated in <span class="Italic">brahm&#257;nanda,</span> which is ultimately unlimited. Therefore the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana</span> movement contributed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Lord Caitanya is the direct and easiest process for coming to the purest form of consciousness&mdash;K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, the platform on which the Supreme Personality is fully realized. Directions for performing different types of <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> are specifically arranged for the highest realization of the Supreme Lord, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by the Lord Himself. <span class="Italic">Ye yath&#257; m&#257;&#7745; prapadyante t&#257;&#7745;s tathaiva bhaj&#257;my aham</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/11?d=1">4.11</a>).

He has repeatedly advised persons who are neophytes to engage themselves in devotional service according to the capacities of the different orders of social and spiritual life, but here he specifically thanks those already engaged in such devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is actually the enjoyer of all sacrificial ceremonies and who is also the supreme teacher as <span class="Italic">antary&#257;m&#299;,</span> or Param&#257;tm&#257;.

He manifests Himself as spiritual master both internally and externally to help the conditioned soul both ways. Therefore He has been mentioned herein as <span class="Italic">gurum.</span> It appears, however, that in the time of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu all the people on the surface of the globe were his subjects.

Therefore he thanked them in a humble way for engaging in devotional service and thus bestowing their mercy upon him. In other words, in a state where the citizens and the head of state are engaged in devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they help one another and are mutually benefited.</div>

<div class="First">P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja has explained in the previous verse the importance of devotional service for both the rulers and the citizens of the state. Now he explains how one can be steadily fixed in devotional service. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, while instructing &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, has compared the devotional service of the Lord with a creeper. A creeper has a feeble stem and requires the support of another tree to grow, and while growing, it requires sufficient protection so that it may not be lost. While describing the system of protection for the creeper of devotional service, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has especially stressed protection from offenses unto the lotus feet of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Such offenses are called <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha.</span> <span class="Italic">Apar&#257;dha</span> means &ldquo;offense.&rdquo; If one commits <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dhas,</span> all of his progress in devotional service will be checked. Even though one is very much advanced in devotional service, if he commits offenses at the feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, his advancement is all spoiled. In the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is found that a very great <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, committed a <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha</span> and thus for one full year had to travel all over the universe, even to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, to defend himself from the offense. At last, even when he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, he was refused protection. Therefore one should be very careful about committing offenses at the feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. The most grievous type of <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha</span> is called <span class="Italic">gurv-apar&#257;dha,</span> which refers to offenses at the lotus feet of the spiritual master. In the chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this <span class="Italic">gurv-apar&#257;dha</span> is considered the most grievous offense. <span class="Italic">Guror avaj�&#257; &#347;ruti-&#347;&#257;stra-nindanam</span> (<span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span>). Among the ten offenses committed against the chanting of the holy name, the first offenses are disobedience of the spiritual master and blasphemy of the Vedic literature.</div>
<A NAME="58498"></A><div id="58498"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The simple definition of <span class="Italic">Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava</span> is given by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: a person who immediately reminds one of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. In this verse, both Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are mentioned. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is a learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and is therefore designated as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a-vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, br&#257;hma&#7751;a-pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</span> or as a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In other words, a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is supposed to be a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> already, but a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> may not be a pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. When a person understands his pure identity, <span class="Italic">brahma j&#257;n&#257;ti,</span> he immediately becomes a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> stage, one&rsquo;s understanding of the Absolute Truth is mainly based on the impersonal view. When a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> however, rises to the platform of personal understanding of the Supreme Godhead, he becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is transcendental even to a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In the material conception, the position of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is the highest in human society, but a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is transcendental even to a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Both the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava are spiritually advanced. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s</span> qualifications are mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as truthfulness, mental equanimity, control of the senses, the power of tolerance, simplicity, knowledge of the Absolute Truth, firm faith in the scriptures, and practical application of the brahminical qualities in life. In addition to all these qualifications, when one fully engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja warns his citizens who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord to take care against offenses to the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Offenses at their lotus feet are so destructive that even the descendants of Yadu who were born in the family of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a were destroyed due to offenses at their feet. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate any offense at the lotus feet of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. Sometimes, due to their powerful positions, princes or government servants neglect the position of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, not knowing that because of their offense they will be ruined.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the prime protector of brahminical culture and the cow. Without knowing and respecting these, one cannot realize the science of God, and without this knowledge, any welfare activities or humanitarian propaganda cannot be successful. The Lord is <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> or the supreme enjoyer.

Since He is perpetually supremely perfect, He does not need to obtain anything, but still it is said that He obtained His opulences by worshiping the lotus feet of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as.</span> These are His exemplary actions. When Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was in Dv&#257;rak&#257;, He offered His respects by bowing down at the lotus feet of N&#257;rada. When Sud&#257;m&#257; Vipra came to His house, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a personally washed his feet and gave him a seat on His personal bed. Although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a offered His respects to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira and Kunt&#299;. The Lord&rsquo;s exemplary behavior is to teach us. We should learn from His personal behavior how to give protection to the cow, how to cultivate brahminical qualities and how to respect the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. The Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/21?d=1">3.21</a>), <span class="Italic">yad yad &#257;carati &#347;re&#7779;&#7789;has tat tad evetaro jana&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;If the leading personalities behave in a certain manner, others follow them automatically.&rdquo; Who can be more of a leading personality than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whose behavior could be more exemplary? It is not that He needed to do all these things to acquire material gain, but all of these acts were performed just to teach us how to behave in this material world.</div>

The difficulty, according to the <span class="Italic">Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> is that demons, taking advantage of Kali-yuga, have taken birth in <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> families. <span class="Italic">R&#257;k&#7779;as&#257;&#7717; kalim &#257;&#347;ritya j&#257;yante brahma-yoni&#7779;u</span> (<span class="Italic">Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span>). In other words, in this age there are many so-called caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and caste Gosv&#257;m&#299;s who, taking advantage of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> and of the innocence of people in general, claim to be <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas by hereditary right. One will not derive any benefit by rendering service to such false <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a-kulas.</span> One must therefore take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and his associates and should also render service to them, for such activity will greatly help the neophyte in attaining full satisfaction. This has been very clearly explained by &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura in his explanation of the verse <span class="Italic">vyavas&#257;y&#257;tmik&#257; buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/41?d=1">2.41</a>). By actually following the regulative principles of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> as recommended by &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, one can very quickly come to the transcendental platform of liberation, as explained in this verse (<span class="Italic">atyanta-&#347;amam</span>).</div>

<div class="Purport">The particular use of the word <span class="Italic">anativelam</span> (&ldquo;without delay&rdquo;) is very significant because simply by serving <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas one can get liberation. There is no need to undergo severe penances and austerities. The vivid example of this is N&#257;rada Muni himself. In his previous birth, he was simply a maidservant&rsquo;s son, but he got the opportunity to serve exalted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, and thus in his next life he not only became liberated, but became famous as the supreme spiritual master of the entire Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava disciplic succession.

<div class="Translation">In brahminical culture a br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s transcendental position is eternally maintained because the injunctions of the Vedas are accepted with faith, austerity, scriptural conclusions, full sense and mind control, and meditation.

<div class="First">Since it is described in the previous verse that feeding a living <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is more effective than offering oblations in a fire sacrifice, in this verse it is now clearly described what br&#257;hma&#7751;ism is and who a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is. In the age of Kali, taking advantage of the fact that by feeding a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> one obtains a more effective result than by performing sacrifices, a class of men with no brahminical qualifications claim the eating privilege known as <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a-bhojana</span> simply on the basis of their birth in <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> families. In order to distinguish this class of men from the real <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu is giving an exact description of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and brahminical culture. One should not take advantage of his position simply to live like a fire without light. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> must be fully conversant with the Vedic conclusion, which is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>). The Vedic conclusion&mdash;the ultimate understanding, or Ved&#257;nta understanding&mdash;is knowledge of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Actually that is a fact because simply by understanding K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as He is, as described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam eva&#7745; yo vetti tattvata&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/9?d=1">4.9</a>]), one becomes a perfect <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> who knows K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a perfectly well is always in a transcendental position. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/14/26?d=1">14.26</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">Therefore a devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is actually a perfect <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> His situation is transcendental, for he is free from the four defects of conditional life, which are the tendencies to commit mistakes, to be illusioned, to cheat and to possess imperfect senses. A perfect Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person, is always in this transcendental position because he speaks according to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and His representative. Because Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas speak exactly according to the tune of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whatever they say is free from these four defects. For example, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that everyone should always think of Him, everyone should become His devotee, offer Him obeisances and worship Him, and ultimately everyone should surrender unto Him. These devotional activities are transcendental and free from mistakes, illusion, cheating and imperfection. Therefore anyone who is a sincere devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and who preaches this cult, speaking only on the basis of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s instructions, is understood to be <span class="Italic">virajam,</span> or free from the defects of material contamination. A genuine <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava therefore depends eternally on the conclusion of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> or Vedic versions presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Only from Vedic knowledge can we understand the actual position of the Absolute Truth, who, as described in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> is manifested in three features&mdash;namely impersonal Brahman, localized Param&#257;tm&#257; and, at last, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This knowledge is perfect from time immemorial, and the brahminical or Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava culture depends on this principle eternally. One should therefore study the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> with faith, not only for one&rsquo;s personal knowledge, but for the sake of spreading this knowledge and these activities through real faith in the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<A NAME="58577"></A><div id="58577"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">ma&#7749;gala</span> (&ldquo;auspicious&rdquo;) in this verse is very significant. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; quotes that to do what is good and to reject what is not good is called <span class="Italic">ma&#7749;gala,</span> or auspicious. To do what is good means to accept everything favorable to the discharge of devotional service, and to reject what is not good means to reject everything not favorable for discharging devotional service. In our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, we accept this principle by rejecting four prohibited items&mdash;namely illicit sex life, intoxication, gambling and flesh-eating&mdash;and accepting the daily chanting of at least sixteen rounds of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> and daily meditation three times a day by chanting the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> In this way one can keep his brahminical culture and spiritual strength intact. By following these principles of devotional service strictly, chanting twenty-four hours a day the <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span>&mdash;Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare&mdash;one makes positive progress in spiritual life and ultimately becomes completely fit to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Because the ultimate goal of studying or understanding the Vedic knowledge is to find K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one who follows the Vedic principles as described above can from the very beginning see all the features of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Absolute Truth, very distinctly, as one can see one&rsquo;s own face completely reflected in a clear mirror. The conclusion is, therefore, that a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> does not become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> simply because he is a living entity or is born in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family; he must possess all the qualities mentioned in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> and practice the brahminical principles in his life. Thus he ultimately becomes a fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person and can understand what K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is. How a devotee continuously sees K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a face to face within his heart is described in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.38) as follows:</div>

A great soul who has fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord after understanding Him fully and after repeatedly undergoing austerities and penances for many, many lives is very rare.

Marriage is not intended for sense gratification but for getting a son fully qualified to deliver his father.

It is therefore the duty of a father to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and raise his children to become Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas; then even if by chance the father falls into a hellish life in his next birth, such a son can deliver him, as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu delivered his father.</div>

The rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in expectation of a good reward is deprecated by Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja as mercantile business. Because Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he did not ask a benediction for his personal self but was very affectionate toward his father. Although his father tortured him and would have killed him had he himself not been killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja begged pardon for him from the Lord. This favor was immediately granted by the Lord, and Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was delivered from the darkest region of hellish life, and he returned back home, back to Godhead, by the grace of his son. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is the topmost example of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, who is always compassionate toward sinful persons suffering a hellish life within this material world.

They undergo all kinds of tribulations, suffering them with tolerance, because that is another qualification of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, who tries to deliver all sinful persons from the hellish conditions of material existence.

<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">v&#257;�ch&#257;-kalpatarubhya&#347; ca<br>k&#7771;p&#257;-sindhubhya eva ca<br>patit&#257;n&#257;&#7745; p&#257;vanebhyo<br>vai&#7779;&#7751;avebhyo namo nama&#7717;</div>
</div><A NAME="58691"></A><div id="58691"> </div>
<div class="After-Verse">Only a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava leader can fulfill all the desires of the people (<span class="Italic">v&#257;�ch&#257;-kalpataru</span>), and he is compassionate because he is the contributor of the greatest benefit to human society. He is <span class="Italic">patita-p&#257;vana,</span> the deliverer of all fallen souls, because if the king or the head of the government follows in the footsteps of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, who are naturally leaders in missionary work, the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> will also follow in the footsteps of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas and <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> will give them service. Thus the entire society becomes a perfect human institution for combined progress to the highest perfection of life.</div>

<div class="Translation">The citizens continued: Today you have opened our eyes and revealed how to cross to the other side of the ocean of darkness. By our past deeds and by the arrangement of superior authority, we are entangled in a network of fruitive activities and have lost sight of the destination of life; thus we have been wandering within the universe.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse, the words <span class="Italic">karmabhir daiva-sa&#7745;j�itai&#7717;</span> are very significant. Due to the quality of our actions, we come to the association of the modes of material nature, and by superior arrangement we are given a chance to enjoy the fruitive results of such activities in different types of bodies. In this way, having lost sight of their destinations in life, all living entities are wandering in different species throughout the universe, sometimes getting birth in a lower species and sometimes existence in higher planetary systems; thus we are all wandering since time immemorial. It is by the grace of the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead that we get the clue of devotional life, and thus progressive success in our life begins. Here this is admitted by the citizens of King P&#7771;thu; in full consciousness they admit the benefit they have derived from the activities of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu.</div>

<div class="Translation">Dear lord, you are situated in your pure existential position of goodness; therefore you are the perfect representative of the Supreme Lord. You are glorified by your own prowess, and thus you are maintaining the entire world by introducing brahminical culture and protecting everyone in your line of duty as a k&#7779;atriya.<span class="Italic"></span></div>

<div class="First">Without the spread of brahminical culture and without proper protection from the government, no social standard can be maintained properly. This is admitted in this verse by the citizens of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, who could maintain the wonderful situation of his government due to his position in pure goodness. The word <span class="Italic">viv&#7771;ddha-sattv&#257;ya</span> is significant. In the material world there are three qualities&mdash;namely goodness, passion and ignorance. One has to be raised from the platform of ignorance to the platform of goodness by devotional service. There is no other means for elevating one from the lowest stage of life to the highest stage but the execution of devotional service; as advised in the previous chapters of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> one can raise himself from the lowest position to the highest simply by associating with devotees and hearing <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> regularly from their mouths.</div>
<A NAME="58718"></A><div id="58718"> </div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">&#347;&#7771;&#7751;vat&#257;&#7745; sva-kath&#257;&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;<br>pu&#7751;ya-&#347;rava&#7751;a-k&#299;rtana&#7717;<br>h&#7771;dy anta&#7717;-stho hy abhadr&#257;&#7751;i<br>vidhunoti suh&#7771;t sat&#257;m</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;When one engages in devotional service in the first stages of hearing and chanting, the Lord, who is in everyone&rsquo;s heart, helps the devotee in cleansing his heart.&rdquo; (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/17?d=1">1.2.17</a>) In the gradual cleansing process, one is relieved of the influence of passion and ignorance and is situated on the platform of goodness. The result of association with the qualities of passion and ignorance is that one becomes lusty and greedy. But when one is elevated to the platform of goodness, he is satisfied in any condition of life and is without lust and greed. This mentality indicates one&rsquo;s situation on the platform of goodness. One has to transcend this goodness and raise himself to the pure goodness called <span class="Italic">viv&#7771;ddha-sattva,</span> or the advanced stage of goodness. In the advanced stage of goodness one can become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu is addressed here as <span class="Italic">viv&#7771;ddha-sattva,</span> or one who is situated in the transcendental position. But Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, although situated in the transcendental position of a pure devotee, came down to the position of <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> for the benefit of human society and thus gave protection to the entire world by his personal prowess. Although he was a king, a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> because he was a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava he was also a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> As a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> he could give proper instruction to the citizens, and as a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> he could rightly give protection to all of them. Thus the citizens of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu were protected in all respects by the perfect king.</div>
