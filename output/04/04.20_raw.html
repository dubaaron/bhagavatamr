Since the individual self is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the self and the Superself are qualitatively nondifferent. As the next verse will explain, the body is only a superficial covering, and consequently an advanced transcendentalist will not make a distinction between one self and another.</div>

<div class="First">In daily life we find that when a madman commits murder, he is excused even by a high-court judge. The idea is that a living entity is always pure because he is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When he falls into the clutches of material energy, he becomes a victim of the three modes of material nature. Indeed, whatever he does, he does under the influence of material nature. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/5/14?d=1">5.14</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">Actually the living entity, or soul, does not do anything; everything is done under the influence of the modes of material nature.

Advanced transcendentalists are called <span class="Italic">sudhiya&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Sudh&#299;</span> means &ldquo;intelligence,&rdquo; <span class="Italic">sudh&#299;</span> means &ldquo;highly advanced,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">sudh&#299;</span> means &ldquo;devotee.&rdquo; One who is both devoted and highly advanced in intelligence does not take action against the soul or the body. If there is any discrepancy, he forgives. It is said that forgiveness is a quality of those who are advancing in spiritual knowledge.</div>

<div class="First">As stated in a previous verse, those with good intellect (<span class="Italic">sudhiya&#7717;</span>) do not accept themselves to be the body. Being a creation of nescience, the body has two types of activities. In the bodily conception, when we think that sense gratification will help us, we are in illusion. Another kind of illusion is to think that one will become happy by trying to satisfy the desires that arise from the illusory body or by attaining elevation to the higher planetary systems or by performing various types of Vedic rituals. This is all illusion. Similarly, material activities performed for political emancipation and social and humanitarian activities performed with an idea that people of the world will be happy are also illusory because the basic principle is the bodily conception, which is illusory. Whatever we desire or perform under the bodily conception is all illusion. In other words, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u informed P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja that although the sacrificial performances set an example for ordinary people, there was no need for such sacrificial performances as far as his personal self was concerned.

<div class="First">The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are certainly meant to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. However, by such activities one does not factually satisfy the Lord. Rather, with the sanction of the Lord, one tries to satisfy one&rsquo;s own senses. In other words, materialists, who are especially interested in sense gratification, are given permission or license to enjoy sense gratification by executing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. That is called <span class="Italic">traigu&#7751;ya-vi&#7779;ay&#257; ved&#257;&#7717;.</span> The Vedic performances are based on the three modes of material nature. Those who are elevated above the material condition are not at all interested in such Vedic performances. Rather, they are interested in the higher duties of transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such devotional service is called <span class="Italic">nistraigu&#7751;ya.</span> Devotional service to the Lord has nothing to do with the material conception of bodily comfort.</div>

<div class="First">In the previous verse two significant words are used: <span class="Italic">asa&#7745;sakta&#7717;,</span> meaning &ldquo;without attachment,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">budha&#7717;,</span> meaning &ldquo;fully cognizant of everything.&rdquo; By full cognizance it is meant that one should know about his own constitutional position as well as the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to &#346;r&#299; Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, in this verse Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is describing Himself, or the Param&#257;tm&#257;. The Param&#257;tm&#257; is always distinguished from the embodied soul as well as the material world. Therefore He has been described as <span class="Italic">para.</span> That <span class="Italic">para,</span> or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is <span class="Italic">eka,</span> meaning &ldquo;one.&rdquo; The Lord is one, whereas the conditioned souls embodied within the material world exist in many varieties of form. There are demigods, human beings, animals, trees, birds, bees and so forth. Thus the living entities are not <span class="Italic">eka</span> but many. As confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas:</span> <span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m.</span> The living entities, who are many and who are entangled in this material world, are not pure. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pure and detached. Due to being covered by the material body, the living entities are not self-effulgent, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param&#257;tm&#257;, is self-effulgent. The living entities, being contaminated by the modes of material nature, are called <span class="Italic">sagu&#7751;a,</span> whereas Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a,</span> not being under the influence of the material modes. The living entities, being encaged in material qualities, are <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;&#257;&#347;rita,</span> whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;&#257;&#347;raya.</span> The conditioned soul&rsquo;s vision is covered by material contamination; therefore he cannot see the cause of his actions, and he cannot see his past lives. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, not being covered by a material body, is the witness of all the activities of the living entity. But both of them, the living entity and the Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;,</span> or spirit. They are one in quality, yet they are different in so many ways, especially in regard to the six opulences the Supreme Personality of Godhead has in full. Full knowledge means that the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-&#257;tm&#257;,</span> the living entity, must know both his position and the Supreme&rsquo;s position. That is full knowledge.</div>

In this material world everyone is engaged in various professional and occupational duties, but the purpose of such activities should be to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devotional service is very simple, and anyone can adopt it. Let one remain what he is; he need only install the Deity of the Supreme Lord in his house. The Deity may be R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or Lak&#7779;m&#299;-N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a (there are many other forms of the Lord).

Regardless of one&rsquo;s occupational duty, one should adopt the devotional means of hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, offering everything to the Lord and engaging in His service. In this way one can very easily engage himself in the service of the Lord. When the Lord is pleased with one&rsquo;s service, one&rsquo;s mission in life is fulfilled.</div>

<div class="First">This verse describes how one can become liberated from material bondage. The first point is that one must know that the soul is different from his body. The soul is called <span class="Italic">deh&#299;,</span> or one who possesses the body, and the material body is called <span class="Italic">deha,</span> or the embodiment of the soul. The body is changing at every moment, but the soul is fixed; therefore the soul is called <span class="Italic">k&#363;&#7789;a-stham.</span> The change of body is enacted by the reactions of the three modes of nature. One who has understood the fixed position of the soul should not be disturbed by the incoming and outgoing interactions of the modes of material nature in the form of happiness and distress. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> also, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a recommends that since happiness and distress come and go due to the interaction of the modes of nature on the body, one should not be disturbed by such external movements. Even though one is sometimes absorbed in such external movements, he has to learn to tolerate them. The living entity should be always indifferent to the action and reaction of the external body.</div>
<A NAME="57610"></A><div id="57610"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> that the body, made of the gross physical elements (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the subtle elements (mind, intelligence and ego), is completely different from the soul proper. One should therefore not be disturbed by the action and reaction of these eight gross and subtle material elements. The practical process to attain this stage of indifference is to execute devotional service. Only one who constantly engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day can be indifferent to the action and reaction of the external body. When a man is absorbed in a particular thought, he does not hear or see any external activities, even though they are enacted in his presence. Similarly, those who are fully absorbed in devotional service do not care what is going on with the external body. That status is called <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span> One who is actually situated in <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi</span> is understood to be a first-class <span class="Italic">yog&#299;.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u told King P&#7771;thu: My dear King, the constant change of this material world is due to the interaction of the three modes of material nature. The five elements, the senses, the demigods who control the senses, as well as the mind, which is agitated by the spirit soul&mdash;all these taken together comprise the body. Since the spirit soul is completely different from this combination of gross and subtle material elements, My devotee who is connected with Me in intense friendship and affection, being completely in knowledge, is never agitated by material happiness and distress.</div>

<div class="First">The question may be raised that if the living entity has to act as the superintendent of the activities of the bodily combination, then how can he be indifferent to the activities of the body? The answer is given here: these activities are completely different from the activities of the spirit soul of the living entity. A crude example can be given in this connection. A businessman riding in a motorcar sits in the car, supervises its running and advises the driver. He knows how much gasoline is used up, and he knows everything about the car, but still he is apart from the car and is more concerned with his business. Even while riding in the car, he thinks of his business and his office. He has no connection with the car, although he is sitting there. As the businessman is always absorbed in thoughts of his business, so the living entity can be absorbed in thoughts of rendering loving service to the Lord. Then it will be possible to remain separate from the activities of the material body. This position of neutrality can be possible only for a devotee.</div>

Their aim of life is to give comfort to the body only. <span class="Italic">J�&#257;n&#299;s</span> try to get out of entanglement by philosophical speculation, but they have no standing in the liberated position. Because they do not take shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord, they fall down from the exalted position of Brahman realization. <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s</span> also have a bodily concept of life&mdash;they think that they can achieve something spiritual by exercising the body through <span class="Italic">dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;, &#257;sana, pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma,</span> etc. A devotee&rsquo;s position is always transcendental because of his intimate relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, to remain always aloof from the actions and reactions of the body and engage in one&rsquo;s real occupation, namely rendering service to the Lord, can be possible only for devotees.</div>

<div class="First">Here is an example of receiving direct instruction from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. One has to execute the order of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, whether receiving it directly from Him or from His bona fide representative, the spiritual master. Arjuna fought the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra under the direct order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Similarly, here P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is also being given orders by Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u regarding the execution of his duty. We have to stick to the principles stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Vyavas&#257;y&#257;tmik&#257; buddhi&#7717;:</span> every man&rsquo;s duty is to receive orders from Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or from His bona fide representative and take these orders as his life and soul, without personal considerations. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura states that one should not care very much whether he is going to be liberated or not, but he should simply execute the direct order received from the spiritual master. If one sticks to the principle of abiding by the order of the spiritual master, he will always remain in a liberated position. A common man must execute the rules and regulations of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> by working in his prescribed duty according to the caste system (<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span>) and the spiritual-order system (<span class="Italic">brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span>).

<div class="Purport">As a king, P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was ordered by Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to keep himself always aloof from the activities of the bodily situation and to engage always in the service of the Lord and thus keep himself in the liberated stage. The word <span class="Italic">baddha-sauh&#7771;d&#257;&#7717;</span> in the previous verse is explained herewith. One can fully remain in intimate connection with the Supreme Lord directly or receive orders from His bona fide representative the spiritual master and execute the orders sincerely when one keeps aloof from the activities of the body. The Lord helps us by giving us directions how to act in devotional service and thus advance on the path back home, back to Godhead. He instructs us outwardly in the form of the spiritual master. Therefore, one should not accept the spiritual master as an ordinary human being. The Lord says, <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya&#7745; m&#257;&#7745; vij&#257;n&#299;y&#257;n n&#257;va-manyeta karhicit:</span> one should not treat the spiritual master as an ordinary human being, for he is the substitute for the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 11.17.27). One should treat the spiritual master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and never be envious of him or consider him to be an ordinary human being. If we follow the instruction of the spiritual master and execute devotional service to the Lord, we will remain always free from the contamination of bodily and material activities, and our life will be successful.</div>

By acting in that way, the king in his next life shares one sixth of the result of the pious activities of the citizens.

<div class="First">The question may be raised here that if everyone engaged in spiritual activities to attain salvation and became indifferent to the activities of the material world, then how could things as they are go on? And if things are to go on as they ought to, how can a head of state be indifferent to such activities? In answer to this question, the word <span class="Italic">&#347;reya&#7717;,</span> auspicious, is used here. The division of activities in society as arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead was not blindly or accidently created, as foolish people say. The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> must do his duty properly, and the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya,</span> the <span class="Italic">vai&#347;ya</span> and even the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> must do the same. And every one of them can achieve the highest perfection of life&mdash;liberation from this material bondage. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/45?d=1">18.45</a>). <span class="Italic">Sve sve karma&#7751;y abhirata&#7717; sa&#7745;siddhi&#7745; labhate nara&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;By executing one&rsquo;s prescribed duties, one can attain the highest perfection.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Purport">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u advised Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu that a king is not enjoined to give up his kingdom and the responsibility of protecting the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s,</span> or citizens, to instead go away to the Himalayas for liberation. He can attain liberation while executing his royal duties. The royal duty or the duty of the head of state is to see that the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s,</span> or the general mass of people, are doing their respective duties for spiritual salvation. A secular state does not necessitate a king or head of state who is indifferent to the activities of the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s.</span> In the modern state the government has many rules and regulations for conducting the duties of the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;s,</span> but the government neglects to see that the citizens advance in spiritual knowledge. If the government is careless in this matter, the citizens will act whimsically, without any sense of God realization or spiritual life, and thus become entangled in sinful activities.</div>
<A NAME="57653"></A><div id="57653"> </div>
<div class="Purport">An executive head should not be callous to the welfare of the general mass of people while he simply goes on collecting taxes. The king&rsquo;s real duty is to see that the citizens gradually become fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious means completely free from all sinful activities. As soon as there is complete eradication of sinful activities in the state, then there will be no more war, pestilence, famine or natural disturbances. This was actually prevailing during the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. If a king or head of the government is able to induce the citizens to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, then he is worthy to rule over the mass of people; otherwise, he has no right to levy taxes. If the king looks after the spiritual interests of the citizens, he can levy taxes without difficulties. In this way both the subjects and the king will be happy during this life, and in the next life the king will be able to share one sixth of the pious activities of the citizens. Otherwise, by levying taxes on the sinful citizens, he will have to share the reactions of their sinful activities.</div>
<A NAME="57654"></A><div id="57654"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This same principle can be applied to parents and spiritual masters as well. If parents simply give birth to children like cats and dogs but cannot save their children from imminent death, they become responsible for the activities of their animalistic children. Lately, such children are turning into hippies. Similarly, if a spiritual master cannot direct his disciples to become free of sinful activities, he becomes responsible for their sinful acts. These subtle laws of nature are unknown to the present leaders of society. Since the leaders of society have a poor fund of knowledge and the citizens in general are rogues and thieves, there cannot be an auspicious situation for human society. At the present moment the whole world is full of such an incompatible combination of state and citizens, and therefore there is constant tension, war and anxiety as an inevitable result of such social conditions.</div>

There were no mistakes in ruling over the country, and everything went perfectly. The citizens were completely pious, the king levied taxes legitimately, and therefore the situation was very happy. At the present moment the so-called executive heads are more or less selected from materially ambitious persons who simply look after their own personal interests; they have no knowledge of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> In other words, the executive heads are fools and rascals in the strict sense of the terms, and the people in general are <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> This combination of fools and rascals and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> cannot bring about peace and prosperity in this world. Therefore we find periodic upheavals in society in the forms of battles, communal riots and fratricidal quarrels. Under these circumstances, not only are the leaders unable to lead the people toward liberation, but they cannot even give them peace of mind. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated that anyone who lives on concocted ideas, without reference to the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> never becomes successful and does not attain happiness or liberation after death.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u was very pleased with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu&rsquo;s good character and behavior and offered him a benediction. The Lord openly says that performing great sacrifices or undergoing the austerities of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice cannot satisfy Him. He is pleased only by elevated character and behavior. But these cannot develop unless one becomes a pure devotee of the Lord. Anyone who has developed unalloyed, unflinching devotional service unto the Lord develops his original good qualities as spirit soul. The spirit soul, as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has all the good qualities of the Lord. When the spirit soul is contaminated by the material modes of nature, one is considered good or bad with reference to the material qualities. But when one is transcendental to all material qualities, all the good qualities come out. These qualities of a devotee, twenty-six in number, are listed as follows: (1) kind to everyone, (2) does not quarrel with anyone, (3) fixed in the Absolute Truth, (4) equal to everyone, (5) faultless, (6) charitable, (7) mild, (8) clean, (9) simple, (10) benevolent, (11) peaceful, (12) completely attached to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, (13) has no material hankering, (14) meek, (15) steady, (16) self-controlled, (17) does not eat more than required, (18) sane, (19) respectful, (20) humble, (21) grave, (22) compassionate, (23) friendly, (24) poetic, (25) expert, (26) silent. The Lord is satisfied by development of the transcendental qualities of the living entity and not by artificial performance of sacrifices and mystic <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> In other words, unless one is fully qualified to become a pure devotee of the Lord, one cannot expect to be liberated from material entanglement.</div>

<div class="First">There are many cases in which a person becomes an offender to the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and later becomes repentant. Here also we find that although the King of heaven, Indra, was so powerful that he accompanied Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, he felt himself a great offender for stealing P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s horse that was meant for sacrifice. An offender at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is never excused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many instances illustrating this fact. Ambar&#299;&#7779;a Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was offended by Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni, a great sage and mystic <span class="Italic">yog&#299;,</span> and Durv&#257;s&#257; also had to fall down at the lotus feet of Ambar&#299;&#7779;a Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Indra decided to fall down at the lotus feet of King P&#7771;thu, but the King was so magnanimous a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava that he did not want Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Indra to fall down at his feet. Instead, King P&#7771;thu immediately picked him up and embraced him, and both of them forgot all the past incidents. Both King Indra and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu were envious and angry with each other, but since both of them were Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, or servants of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, it was their duty to adjust the cause of their envy. This is also a first-class example of cooperative behavior between Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. In the present days, however, because people are not Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas, they fight perpetually among one another and are vanquished without finishing the mission of human life. There is a great need to propagate the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement in the world so that even though people sometimes become angry and malicious toward one another, because of their being K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious such rivalry, competition and envy can be adjusted without difficulty.</div>

<div class="First">Just as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is addressed in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">&#257;di-puru&#7779;a,</span> the original personality, so King P&#7771;thu, being an empowered incarnation of the Lord, is referred to in this verse as <span class="Italic">&#257;di-r&#257;ja&#7717;,</span> the original or ideal king. He was a great devotee and at the same time a great hero who conquered over all undesirable elements in his kingdom. He was so powerful that he was equal in fighting to Indra, the King of heaven. He gave protection to his citizens, keeping them engaged in pious activities and devotion to the Lord. He did not collect a single cent of taxes from the citizens without being able to give them protection from all calamities. The greatest calamity in life is to become godless and therefore sinful. If the state head or king allows the citizens to become sinful by indulging in illicit sex life, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, then the king is responsible, and he has to suffer the resultant sequence of reactions for the sinful lives of the citizens because he levies taxes on them unnecessarily. These are the principles for a ruling power, and because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu observed all the principles for a ruling chief, he is referred to here as <span class="Italic">&#257;di-r&#257;ja&#7717;.</span></div>

<div class="Purport">Even a responsible king like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu can become a pure devotee of the first order. We can distinctly see from King P&#7771;thu&rsquo;s behavior how he became ecstatic, both externally and internally, in pure devotional service.</div>

<div class="Purport">Just today we have seen in the newspapers of Bombay that the government is going to repeal its prohibition laws. Ever since Gandhi&rsquo;s noncooperation movement, Bombay has been kept dry and has not allowed its citizens to drink. But unfortunately the citizens are so clever that they have increased illicit distillation of liquor, and although not being sold publicly in shops, liquor is being sold in public lavatories and similar abnormal places. Unable to check such illicit smuggling, the government has decided to manufacture the liquor at cheaper prices so that people can have their supply of intoxication directly from the government instead of purchasing it in public lavatories. The government failed to change the hearts of the citizens from indulging in sinful life, so instead of losing the taxes they collect to inflate the treasury, they have decided to manufacture liquor to supply to the citizens who hanker after it.</div>
<A NAME="57754"></A><div id="57754"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This kind of government cannot check the resultant actions of sinful life, namely war, pestilence, famine, earthquakes and similar other disturbances. Nature&rsquo;s law is that as soon as there are discrepancies in regard to the law of God (which are described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">dharmasya gl&#257;ni&#7717;,</span> or disobedience to the laws of nature or God), at once there will be heavy punishment in the form of sudden outbreaks of war. We have recently experienced a war between India and Pakistan. Within fourteen days there have been immense losses of men and money, and there have been disturbances to the entire world. These are the reactions of sinful life. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is meant to make people pure and perfect. If we become even partially pure, as described in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<span class="Italic">na&#7779;&#7789;a-pr&#257;ye&#7779;v abhadre&#7779;u</I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/18?d=1">1.2.18</a></I>]</span></I>), by development of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, then lust and greed, the material diseases of the citizens, will be reduced. This can be made possible simply by broadcasting the pure message of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Big commercial and industrial firms have contributed many thousands of rupees to a defense fund that burns the money in the form of gunpowder, but unfortunately, if they are asked to contribute liberally to advance the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, they are reluctant. Under the circumstances, the world will periodically suffer from such upsurges and outbreaks of war, which are the consequences of not being K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious.</div>

<div class="Translation">The Supreme Personality of Godhead stood with His lotus feet almost touching the ground while He rested the front of His hand on the raised shoulder of Garu&#7693;a, the enemy of the snakes.

<div class="First">The significant point in this verse is that the Lord was standing above the ground, almost touching it. The residents of the upper planetary systems, beginning from Brahmaloka (the planet where Lord Brahm&#257; lives) down to Svargaloka (the heavenly planet of Indra), are so advanced in spiritual life that when they come to visit this or similar other lower planetary systems, they keep their weightlessness. This means that they can stand without touching the ground. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because He lives in one of the planetary systems within this universe, He sometimes plays as if one of the demigods of this universe. When He first appeared before P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He was not touching the ground of this earth, but when He was fully satisfied with the behavior and character of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, He immediately acted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. Out of affection for P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He touched the earth, but He rested the front of His hand on the raised shoulder of Garu&#7693;a, His carrier, as if to prevent Himself from falling down, since the Lord is not accustomed to stand on earthly ground. These are all symptoms of His great affection for P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. perceiving his fortunate position, P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could not fully look upon the Lord due to ecstasy, but still, in a faltering voice, he began to offer prayers.</div>

<div class="First">There are different kinds of benedictions according to a person&rsquo;s demands. For <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> the best benediction is promotion to the higher planetary systems, where the duration of life is very long and the standard of living and happiness is very high. There are others, namely <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> who want the benediction of merging into the existence of the Lord. This is called <span class="Italic">kaivalya.</span> The Lord is therefore addressed as <span class="Italic">kaivalya-pati,</span> the master or Lord of the benediction known as <span class="Italic">kaivalya.</span> But devotees receive a different type of benediction from the Lord. Devotees are anxious neither for the heavenly planets nor for merging into the existence of the Lord. According to devotees, <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> or merging into the existence of the Lord, is considered as good as hell. The word <span class="Italic">naraka</span> means &ldquo;hell.&rdquo; Similarly, everyone who exists in this material world is called <span class="Italic">n&#257;raka</span> because this material existence itself is known as a hellish condition of life. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, however, expressed that he was interested neither in the benediction desired by the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> nor that desired by the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; Prabhu, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, described that <span class="Italic">kaivalya</span> is no better than a hellish condition of life, and as for the delights of the heavenly planets, they are factually will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps, or phantasmagoria. They are not wanted by devotees. Devotees do not even care for the positions held by Lord Brahm&#257; or Lord &#346;iva, nor does a devotee desire to become equal with Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. As a pure devotee of the Lord, P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja made his position very clear.</div>

One might think that these glories of the Lord can be heard from anywhere, from the mouths of either devotees or nondevotees, but here it is specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord must emanate from the mouths of pure devotees. &#346;r&#299; San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299; has strictly prohibited hearing from the mouth of a nondevotee. There are many professional reciters of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> who speak the narrations very ornamentally, but a pure devotee does not like to hear from them because such glorification of the Lord is simply a vibration of material sound.

The Lord has innumerable devotees all over the universe, and they have been glorifying the Lord since time immemorial and for an unlimited time. But still they cannot completely finish enumerating the glories of the Lord. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore wanted innumerable ears, as R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; also desired to have millions of ears and millions of tongues to chant and hear the glorification of the Lord. In other words, if our ears are always engaged in hearing the glorification of the Lord, there will be no scope for hearing the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy, which is doom to spiritual progress. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu said that if anyone hears from a M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosopher preaching about the activities of the Lord, even if it is a description from the Vedic literature, he is ultimately doomed.

The transcendental vibration from the mouth of a pure devotee is so powerful that it can revive the living entity&rsquo;s memory of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our material existence, under the influence of illusory <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> we have almost forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord, exactly like a man sleeping very deeply who forgets his duties. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said that every one of us is sleeping under the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> We must get up from this slumber and engage in the right service, for thus we can properly utilize the facility of this human form of life. As expressed in a song by &#7788;h&#257;kura Bhaktivinoda, Lord Caitanya says, <span class="Italic">j&#299;va j&#257;ga, j&#299;va j&#257;ga.</span> The Lord asks every sleeping living entity to get up and engage in devotional service so that his mission in this human form of life may be fulfilled. This awakening voice comes through the mouth of a pure devotee.</div>
<A NAME="57809"></A><div id="57809"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord, taking shelter of His lotus feet, and therefore he has a direct connection with the saffron mercy-particles that are strewn over the lotus feet of the Lord. Although when a pure devotee speaks the articulation of his voice may resemble the sound of this material sky, the voice is spiritually very powerful because it touches the particles of saffron dust on the lotus feet of the Lord. As soon as a sleeping living entity hears the powerful voice emanating from the mouth of a pure devotee, he immediately remembers his eternal relationship with the Lord, although up until that moment he had forgotten everything.</div>
<A NAME="57810"></A><div id="57810"> </div>
<div class="Purport">For a conditioned soul, therefore, it is very important to hear from the mouth of a pure devotee, who is fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord without any material desire, speculative knowledge or contamination of the modes of material nature. Every one of us is <span class="Italic">kuyog&#299;</span> because we have engaged in the service of this material world, forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord as His eternal loving servants. It is our duty to rise from the <span class="Italic">kuyoga</span> platform to become <span class="Italic">suyog&#299;s,</span> perfect mystics. The process of hearing from a pure devotee is recommended in all Vedic scriptures, especially by Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. One may stay in his position of life&mdash;it does not matter what it is&mdash;but if one hears from the mouth of a pure devotee, he gradually comes to the understanding of his relationship with the Lord and thus engages in His loving service, and his life becomes completely perfect. Therefore, this process of hearing from the mouth of a pure devotee is very important for making progress in the line of spiritual understanding.</div>

<div class="First">The association of devotees (<span class="Italic">&#257;rya-sa&#7749;gama</span>) is the most important factor in this world. The word <span class="Italic">&#257;rya</span> refers to those who are advancing spiritually. In the history of the human race, the &#256;ryan family is considered to be the most elevated community in the world because it adopts the Vedic civilization. The &#256;ryan family is distributed all over the world and is known as Indo-&#256;ryan. In prehistoric days all of the members of the &#256;ryan family followed the Vedic principles, and therefore they became spiritually advanced. The kings, known as <span class="Italic">r&#257;jar&#7779;is,</span> were so perfectly educated as <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas,</span> or protectors of the citizens, and so greatly advanced in spiritual life, that there was not a bit of trouble for the citizens.</div>
<A NAME="57824"></A><div id="57824"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The glorification of the Supreme Lord can be very much appreciated by the &#256;ryan family. Although there is no bar for others, the members of the &#256;ryan family very quickly catch the essence of spiritual life. How is it that we are finding it very easy to spread K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness among the Europeans and Americans? History reports that the Americans and Europeans proved their capability when they were anxious to expand colonization, but at the present time, being contaminated by the advancement of material science, their sons and grandsons are turning into reprobates. This is due to their having lost their original spiritual culture, which is Vedic civilization. Presently these descendants of the &#256;ryan family are taking this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement very seriously. Others who are associating with them and hearing the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> from the lips of pure devotees are also becoming captivated by the transcendental vibration. Transcendental vibrations are very much effective when chanted among &#256;ryans, but even though one does not belong to the &#256;ryan family, he will become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava simply by hearing the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> because the vibration has great influence over everyone.</div>
<A NAME="57825"></A><div id="57825"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu points out that even the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, specifically wanted to hear about the Lord&rsquo;s glories, and for the association of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> who are pure devotees, the goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;, underwent severe austerities. The impersonalist may ask why one should bother chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> continually for so many years instead of stopping and trying for <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> liberation, or merging into the existence of the Lord. In answer, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu maintains that the attraction of this chanting is so great that one cannot give up the process unless he is an animal. This is the case even if one comes in contact with this transcendental vibration by chance. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is very emphatic in this connection&mdash;only an animal can give up the practice of chanting Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Those who are not animals but actually intelligent, advanced, human, civilized men cannot give up this practice of continually chanting Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare.</div>

<div class="First">The Lord is here addressed as <span class="Italic">akhila-p&#363;ru&#7779;ottama,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the entire creation. <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> means &ldquo;the enjoyer,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">uttama</span> means &ldquo;the best.&rdquo; There are different kinds of <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;as,</span> or enjoyers, within the universe. Generally they can be divided into three classes&mdash;those who are conditioned, those who are liberated and those who are eternal. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> the Supreme Lord is called the supreme eternal of all eternals (<span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;m</span>). Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities are eternal. The supreme eternals are the <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattva,</span> or Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and His expansions. So <span class="Italic">nitya</span> refers to the Personality of Godhead, beginning from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a and other expansions of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">r&#257;m&#257;di-m&#363;rti&#7779;u</span>), there are millions and trillions of expansions of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, as R&#257;ma, N&#7771;si&#7745;ha, Var&#257;ha and other incarnations. All of them are called eternals.</div>
<A NAME="57839"></A><div id="57839"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">mukta</span> refers to the living entities who never come within this material world. The <span class="Italic">baddhas</span> are those living entities who are almost eternally living within this material world. The <span class="Italic">baddhas</span> are struggling very hard within this material world to become free from the threefold miseries of material nature and to enjoy life, whereas the <span class="Italic">muktas</span> are already liberated. They never come into this material world. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is the master of this material world, and there is no question of His being controlled by material nature. Consequently, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is addressed here as <span class="Italic">p&#363;ru&#7779;ottama,</span> the best of all living entities&mdash;namely <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas</span> and <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattvas.</span> It is a great offense, therefore, to compare Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and the <span class="Italic">j&#299;va-tattva</span> or consider them on an equal level. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers equalize the <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas</span> and the Supreme Lord and consider them to be one, but that is the greatest offense to the lotus feet of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>
<A NAME="57840"></A><div id="57840"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Here in the material world we have practical experience that a superior person is worshiped by an inferior one. Similarly, <span class="Italic">p&#363;ru&#7779;ottama,</span> the greatest, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, is always worshiped by others. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore decided to engage in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, but he is called a <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a</span> incarnation. Another significant word in this verse is <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;&#257;layam,</span> which refers to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u as the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers take the Absolute Truth to be <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a</span> (&ldquo;without qualities&rdquo;), in accordance with the impersonalistic view, but actually the Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities. One of the most important qualities of the Lord is His inclination to His devotees, for which He is called <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala.</span> The devotees are always very much inclined to render service unto the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord is also very much inclined to accept loving service from His devotees. In that exchange of service there are many transcendental transactions, which are called transcendental qualitative activities. Some of the transcendental qualities of the Lord are that He is omniscient, omnipresent, all-pervasive, all-powerful, the cause of all causes, the Absolute Truth, the reservoir of all pleasures, the reservoir of all knowledge, the all-auspicious and so on.</div>
<A NAME="57841"></A><div id="57841"> </div>
<div class="Purport">P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja desired to serve the Lord with the goddess of fortune, but this desire does not mean that he was situated on the platform of <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya-rasa.</span> The goddess of fortune is engaged in the service of the Lord in the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> of <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya,</span> conjugal love. Although her position is on the chest of the Lord, the goddess of fortune, in her position as a devotee, takes pleasure in serving the lotus feet of the Lord. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was thinking only of the lotus feet of the Lord because he is on the platform of <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya-rasa,</span> or servitorship of the Lord. From the next verse we learn that P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was thinking of the goddess of fortune as the universal mother, <span class="Italic">jagan-m&#257;t&#257;.</span> Consequently there was no question of his competing with her on the platform of <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhurya-rasa.</span> Nonetheless he feared that she might take offense at his engaging in the service of the Lord. This suggests that in the absolute world there is sometimes competition between servitors in the service of the Lord, but such competition is without malice. In the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha worlds if a devotee excels in the service of the Lord, others do not become envious of his excellent service but rather aspire to come to the platform of that service.</div>

<div class="First">Mother Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;, the goddess of fortune, is well known for always massaging the lotus feet of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. She is an ideal wife because she takes care of Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a in every detail. She takes care not only of His lotus feet but of the household affairs of the Lord as well. She cooks nice foods for Him, fans Him while He eats, smoothes sandalwood pulp on His face and sets His bed and sitting places in the right order. In this way she is always engaged in the service of the Lord, and there is hardly any opportunity for any other devotee to intrude upon His daily activities. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was therefore almost certain that his intrusion into the service of the goddess of fortune would irritate her and cause her to become angry with him. But why should mother Lak&#7779;m&#299;, the mother of the universe, be angry with an insignificant devotee like P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja? All this was not very likely. Yet P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, just for his personal protection, appealed to the Lord to take his part. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was engaged in performing the ordinary Vedic rituals and sacrifices according to <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> or fruitive activities, but the Lord, being so kind and magnanimous, was ready to award P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja the highest perfectional stage of life, namely devotional service.</div>
<A NAME="57855"></A><div id="57855"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When a person performs Vedic rituals and sacrifices, he does so to elevate himself to the heavenly planets. No one can become qualified to go back home, back to Godhead, by means of such sacrifices. But the Lord is so kind that He accepts a little insignificant service, and therefore it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vi&#7779;&#7751;u Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> that by following the principles of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> one can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, the performer of sacrifices is elevated to the platform of devotional service. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore expected that his insignificant service to the Lord would be accepted by Him as being greater than that of Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;. The goddess of fortune is called <span class="Italic">ca�cal&#257;</span> (&ldquo;restless&rdquo;) because she is very restless and is always coming and going. So P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja indicated that even though she might go away out of anger, there would be no harm for Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, because He is self-sufficient and can do anything and everything without the help of Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;. For example, when Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u begot Lord Brahm&#257; from His navel, He did not take any help from Lak&#7779;m&#299;, who was just sitting by Him and massaging His lotus feet. Generally if a son is to be begotten, the husband impregnates the wife, and in due course of time the son is born. But in the case of Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s birth, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u did not impregnate Lak&#7779;m&#299;j&#299;. Being self-sufficient, the Lord begot Brahm&#257; from His own navel. Therefore, P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was confident that even if the goddess of fortune became angry with him there would be no harm, neither to the Lord nor to himself.</div>

<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are generally engaged in fruitive activities for material bodily comforts. The <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s,</span> however, are disgusted with searching after material comforts. They understand that they have nothing to do with this material world, being spirit souls. After self-realization, the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> who are actually mature in their knowledge must surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord, as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; janman&#257;m ante</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/19?d=1">7.19</a>]). Self-realization is not complete unless one comes to the devotional platform. Therefore it is stated in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> that those who are <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span> self-satisfied, are freed from all contaminations of the material modes of nature. As long as one is affected by the modes of material nature, especially by <span class="Italic">rajas</span> and <span class="Italic">tamas,</span> he will be very greedy and lusty and will therefore engage in hard tasks, laboring all day and night. Such false egoism carries one from one species of life into another perpetually, and there is no rest in any species of life. The <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;</span> understands this fact and therefore ceases to work and takes to <span class="Italic">karma-sanny&#257;sa.</span></div>

<div class="Purport">Yet this is not actually the platform of satisfaction. After self-realization, the material wisdom of the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;</span> leads him to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Then he is satisfied only in contemplating the lotus feet of the Lord constantly. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore concluded that liberated persons taking to the devotional path have acquired the ultimate goal of life. If liberation were the end in itself, there would be no question of a liberated person&rsquo;s taking to devotional service. In other words, the transcendental bliss derived from self-realization, known as <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;nanda,</span> is very insignificant in the presence of the bliss derived from devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore concluded that he would simply hear of the glories of the Lord constantly and thus engage his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord.

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura, a great <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> of the Gau&#7693;&#299;ya-samprad&#257;ya, has said that persons who are very much attached to the fruitive activities of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> namely <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> and <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na-kanda,</span> are certainly doomed. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> there are three categories of activities, known as <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> (fruitive activities), <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> (philosophical research) and <span class="Italic">up&#257;san&#257;-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> (worship of different demigods for receiving material benefits). Those who are engaged in <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> and <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> are doomed in the sense that everyone is doomed who is entrapped by this material body, whether it is a body of a demigod, a king, a lower animal or whatever. The sufferings of the threefold miseries of material nature are the same for all. Cultivation of knowledge to understand one&rsquo;s spiritual position is also, to a certain extent, a waste of time. Because the living entity is an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his immediate business is to engage himself in devotional service. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja therefore says that the allurement of material benedictions is another trap to entangle one in this material world. He therefore frankly tells the Lord that the Lord&rsquo;s offerings of benedictions in the form of material facilities are certainly causes for bewilderment. A pure devotee is not at all interested in <span class="Italic">bhukti</span> or <span class="Italic">mukti.</span></div>
<A NAME="57883"></A><div id="57883"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord sometimes offers benedictions to the neophyte devotees who have not yet understood that material facilities will not make them happy. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> the Lord therefore says that a sincere devotee who is not very intelligent may ask some material benefit from the Lord, but the Lord, being omniscient, does not generally give material rewards but, on the contrary, takes away whatever material facilities are being enjoyed by His devotee, so that ultimately the devotee will completely surrender unto Him. In other words, the offering of benedictions in the form of material profit is never auspicious for the devotee. The statements of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> which offer elevation to heavenly planets in exchange for great sacrifices are simply bewildering. Therefore in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/42-43?d=1">2.42</a>) the Lord says: <span class="Italic">y&#257;m im&#257;&#7745; pu&#7779;pit&#257;&#7745; v&#257;ca&#7745; pravadanty avipa&#347;cita&#7717;.</span> The less intelligent class of men (<span class="Italic">avipa&#347;cita&#7717;</span>), attracted by the flowery language of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> engage in fruitive activities to become materially benefited.

<div class="First">The sum and substance of religious life is to execute the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one who does so is perfectly religious. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/65?d=1">18.65</a>) the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakta&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;Just think of Me always and become My devotee.&rdquo; Furthermore, the Lord says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja:</span> &ldquo;Give up all kinds of material engagement and simply surrender unto Me.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/66?d=1">18.66</a>) This is the primary principle of religion. Anyone who directly executes such an order from the personality of Godhead is actually a religious person. Others are described as pretenders, for there are many activities going on throughout the world in the name of religion which are not actually religious. For one who executes the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, there is only good fortune throughout the world.</div>

<div class="Translation">The great saint Maitreya told Vidura: The Supreme Personality of Godhead amply appreciated the meaningful prayers of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu. Thus, after being properly worshiped by the King, the Lord blessed him and decided to depart.</div>

<div class="First">Most important in this verse are the words <span class="Italic">pratinandy&#257;rthavad vaca&#7717;,</span> which indicate that the Lord appreciated the very meaningful prayers of the King. When a devotee prays to the Lord, it is not to ask for material benefits but to ask the Lord for His favor; he prays that he may be engaged in the service of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet birth after birth. Lord Caitanya therefore uses the words <span class="Italic">mama janmani janmani,</span> which mean &ldquo;birth after birth,&rdquo; because a devotee is not even interested in stopping the repetition of birth. The Lord and the devotee appear in this material world birth after birth, but such births are transcendental. In the Fourth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord informed Arjuna that both He and Arjuna had undergone many, many births previously, but the Lord remembered everything about them whereas Arjuna had forgotten. The Lord and His confidential devotees appear many times to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s mission, but since such births are transcendental, they are not accompanied by the miserable conditions of material birth, and they are therefore called <span class="Italic">divya,</span> transcendental.</div>
<A NAME="57943"></A><div id="57943"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One must understand the transcendental birth of the Lord and the devotee. The purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s taking birth is to establish devotional service, which is the perfect system of religion, and the purpose of the birth of a devotee is to broadcast the same system of religion, or the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, all over the world. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was an incarnation of the power of the Lord to spread the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, and the Lord blessed him to remain fixed in his position. Thus when the King refused to accept any material benediction, the Lord appreciated that refusal very much. Another significant word in this verse is <span class="Italic">acyuta,</span> which means &ldquo;infallible.&rdquo; Although the Lord appears in this material world, He is never to be considered one of the conditioned souls, who are all fallible. When the Lord appears, He remains in His spiritual position, uncontaminated by the modes of material nature, and therefore in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord expresses the quality of His appearance as <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-m&#257;yay&#257;,</span> &ldquo;performed by internal potency.&rdquo; The Lord, being infallible, is not forced by material nature to take birth in this material world. He appears in order to reestablish the perfect order of religious principles and to vanquish the demoniac influence in human society.</div>

<div class="First">In modern so-called scientific society the idea is very prevalent that there is no life on other planets but that only on this earth do living entities with intelligence and scientific knowledge exist. The Vedic literatures, however, do not accept this foolish theory. The followers of Vedic wisdom are fully aware of various planets inhabited by varieties of living entities such as the demigods, the sages, the Pit&#257;s, the Gandharvas, the Pannagas, the Kinnaras, the C&#257;ra&#7751;as, the Siddhas and the Apsar&#257;s. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> give information that in all planets&mdash;not only within this material sky but also in the spiritual sky&mdash;there are varieties of living entities. Although all these living entities are of one spiritual nature, in quality the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they have varieties of bodies due to the embodiment of the spirit soul by the eight material elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego. In the spiritual world, however, there is no such distinction between the body and the embodied. In the material world, distinctive features are manifested in different types of bodies in the various planets. We have full information from the Vedic literature that in each and every planet, both material and spiritual, there are living entities of varied intelligence. The earth is one of the planets of the Bh&#363;rloka planetary system. There are six planetary systems above Bh&#363;rloka and seven planetary systems below it. Therefore the entire universe is known as <span class="Italic">caturda&#347;a-bhuvana,</span> indicating that it has fourteen different planetary systems. Beyond the planetary systems in the material sky, there is another sky, which is known as <span class="Italic">paravyoma,</span> or the spiritual sky, where there are spiritual planets. The inhabitants of those planets engage in varieties of loving service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which include different <span class="Italic">rasas,</span> or relationships, known as <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, v&#257;tsalya-rasa, m&#257;dhurya-rasa</span> and, above all, <span class="Italic">parak&#299;ya-rasa.</span> This <span class="Italic">parak&#299;ya-rasa,</span> or paramour love, is prevalent in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka, where Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a lives. This planet is also called Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and although Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a lives there perpetually, He also expands Himself in millions and trillions of forms. In one of such forms He appears on this material planet in a particular place known as V&#7771;nd&#257;vana-dh&#257;ma, where He displays His original pastimes of Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana-dh&#257;ma in the spiritual sky in order to attract the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead.</div>
