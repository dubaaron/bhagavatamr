<div class="Translation">At the last stage of his life, when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu saw himself getting old, that great soul, who was king of the world, divided whatever opulence he had accumulated amongst all kinds of living entities, moving and nonmoving. He arranged pensions for everyone according to religious principles, and after executing the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in complete coordination with Him, he dedicated his sons unto the earth, which was considered to be his daughter. Then Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu left the presence of his citizens, who were almost lamenting and crying from feeling separation from the King, and went to the forest alone with his wife to perform austerities.</div>

<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu was one of the <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a</span> incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such he appeared on the surface of the earth to execute the orders of the Supreme. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all planets, and He is always anxious to see that in each and every planet the living entities are happily living and executing their duties. As soon as there is some discrepancy in the execution of duties, the Lord appears on earth, as confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/7?d=1">4.7</a>): <span class="Italic">yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya gl&#257;nir bhavati bh&#257;rata.</span></div>
<A NAME="59662"></A><div id="59662"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Since there were so many discrepancies during the reign of King Vena, the Lord sent His most confidential devotee Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu to settle things. Therefore, after executing the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and settling the affairs of the world, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu was ready to retire. He had been exemplary in his governmental administration, and now he was to become exemplary in his retirement. He divided all his property amongst his sons and appointed them to rule the world, and then he went to the forest with his wife. It is significant in this connection that it is said that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu retired alone and at the same time took his wife with him. According to Vedic principles, when retiring from family life, one can take his wife with him, for the husband and wife are considered to be one unit. Thus they can both combinedly perform austerities for liberation. This is the path that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, who was an exemplary character, followed, and this is also the way of Vedic civilization. One should not simply remain at home until the time of death, but should separate from family life at a timely moment and prepare himself to go back to Godhead. As a <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a</span> incarnation of God who had actually come from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha as a representative of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu was certain to go back to Godhead. Nonetheless, in order to set the example in all ways, he also underwent severe austerities in the <span class="Italic">tapo-vana.</span> It appears that in those days there were many <span class="Italic">tapo-vanas,</span> or forests especially meant for retirement and the practice of austerities. Indeed, it was compulsory for everyone to go to the <span class="Italic">tapo-vana</span> to fully accept the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is very difficult to retire from family life and at the same time remain at home.</div>

<div class="Translation">After retiring from family life, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu strictly followed the regulations of retired life and underwent severe austerities in the forest. He engaged in these activities as seriously as he had formerly engaged in leading the government and conquering everyone.</div>

<div class="First">As it is necessary for one to become very active in family life, similarly, after retirement from family life, it is necessary to control the mind and senses. This is possible when one engages himself fully in the devotional service of the Lord. Actually the whole purpose of the Vedic system, the Vedic social order, is to enable one to ultimately return home, back to Godhead. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama</span> is a sort of concession combining sense gratification with a regulative life. It is to enable one to easily retire in the middle of life and engage fully in austerities in order to transcend material sense gratification once and for all. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> stage of life, <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> or austerity, is strongly recommended. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu followed exactly all the rules of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> life, which is technically known as <span class="Italic">vaikh&#257;nasa-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> The word <span class="Italic">vaikh&#257;nasa-susammate</span> is significant because in <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> life the regulative principles are also to be strictly followed. In other words, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu was an ideal character in every sphere of life. <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;jano yena gata&#7717; sa panth&#257;&#7717;:</span> one should follow in the footsteps of great personalities. Thus by following the exemplary character of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, one can become perfect in all respects while living this life or while retiring from active life. Thus after giving up this body, one can become liberated and go back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Translation">In the tapo-vana, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu sometimes ate the trunks and roots of trees, and sometimes he ate fruit and dried leaves, and for some weeks he drank only water. Finally he lived simply by breathing air.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are advised to go to a secluded place in the forest and live alone in a sanctified spot there. By P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s behavior we can understand that when he went to the forest he did not eat any cooked food sent from the city by some devotees or disciples. As soon as one takes a vow to live in the forest, he must simply eat roots, tree trunks, fruits, dried leaves or whatever nature provides in that way. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja strictly adopted these principles for living in the forest, and sometimes he ate nothing but dried leaves and drank nothing but a little water. Sometimes he lived on nothing but air, and sometimes he ate some fruit from the trees. In this way he lived in the forest and underwent severe austerity, especially in regards to eating. In other words, overeating is not at all recommended for one who wants to progress in spiritual life. &#346;r&#299; R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; also warns that too much eating and too much endeavor (<span class="Italic">aty&#257;h&#257;ra&#7717; pray&#257;sa&#347; ca</span>) are against the principles by which one can advance in spiritual life.</div>
<A NAME="59689"></A><div id="59689"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is also notable that according to Vedic injunction, to live in the forest is to live in the mode of complete goodness, whereas to live in the city is to live in the mode of passion, and to live in a brothel or drinking house is to live in the mode of ignorance. However, to live in a temple is to live in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, which is transcendental to all the modes of material nature. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement affords one the opportunity to live in the temple of the Lord, which is as good as Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. Consequently a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious person does not need to go to the forest and artificially try to imitate Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu or the great sages and <span class="Italic">munis</span> who used to live in the forest.</div>
<A NAME="59690"></A><div id="59690"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;, after retiring from his minister&rsquo;s seat in the government, went to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana and lived beneath a tree, like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu. Since then, many people have gone to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to imitate R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;&rsquo;s behavior. Instead of advancing in spiritual life, many have fallen into material habits and even in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana have become victims of illicit sex, gambling and intoxication. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has been introduced in the Western countries, but it is not possible for Westerners to go to the forest and practice the severe austerities which were ideally practiced by P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja or R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;. However, Westerners or anyone else can follow in the footsteps of &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura by living in a temple, which is transcendental to residence in a forest, and to vow to accept <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;da</span> and nothing else, follow the regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds daily of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> In this way, one&rsquo;s spiritual life will never be disturbed.</div>

Similarly, in the rainy season one is enjoined to expose himself to torrents of rain and in winter to sit in cold water up to the neck. As far as bedding is concerned, the ascetic should be content with simply lying on the floor. The purpose for undergoing such severe austerities is to become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as explained in the next verse.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">In order to be recognized by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should chant the holy name of the Lord continuously, twenty-four hours a day. Unfortunate persons who cannot accept this formula prefer to execute some type of pseudomeditation, without accepting the other processes of austerity. The fact is, however, that one must accept either the severe method of austerity described above to become purified or take to the process of devotional service recommended for pleasing the Supreme Lord, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The person who is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious is most intelligent because in Kali-yuga it is not at all possible to undergo such severe austerities. We need only follow great personalities like Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu. In His <span class="Italic">&#346;ik&#7779;&#257;&#7779;&#7789;aka,</span> Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu wrote, <span class="Italic">para&#7745; vijayate &#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam:</span> all glories to the holy names of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which from the very beginning purify the heart and immediately liberate one. <span class="Italic">Bhava-mah&#257;-d&#257;v&#257;gni-nirv&#257;panam.</span> If the real purpose of all <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is to please Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, then this simple <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> system recommended for this age is sufficient. It is necessary, however, to engage constantly in the service of the Lord. Although P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja executed his austerities long before the appearance of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a on this planet, his purpose was still to please K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.</div>
<A NAME="59719"></A><div id="59719"> </div>
<div class="Purport">There are many fools who claim that worship of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a began only about five thousand years ago, after the appearance of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in India, but this is not a fact. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja worshiped K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a millions of years ago, for P&#7771;thu happened to be a descendant of the family of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva, who reigned for thirty-six thousand years during the Satya-yuga age. Unless his total life-span was one hundred thousand years, how could Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja reign over the world for thirty-six thousand years? The point is that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a worship existed at the beginning of creation and has continued to exist throughout Satya-yuga, Tret&#257;-yuga and Dv&#257;para-yuga, and now it is continuing in Kali-yuga. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appears not only in this millennium of Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s life, but in every millennium. Therefore worship of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is conducted in all millenniums. It is not that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a worship began only when K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared on this planet five thousand years ago. This is a foolish conclusion that is not substantiated by Vedic literatures.</div>

<div class="Purport">Also of significance in this verse are the words <span class="Italic">&#257;rir&#257;dhayi&#7779;u&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;am acarat tapa uttamam.</span> Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu underwent severe types of austerities for the express purpose of worshiping K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so kind, especially in this age, that He appears in the transcendental vibration of His holy name. As is said in the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&#241;car&#257;tra, &#257;r&#257;dhito yadi haris tapas&#257; tata&#7717; kim.</span> If K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is worshiped, if He is the goal of advancement, there is no need for one to execute severe types of <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> because one has already reached his destination. If, after executing all types of <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> one cannot reach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, all his <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> has no value, for without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a all austerity is simply wasted labor. <span class="Italic">&#346;rama eva hi kevalam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/8?d=1">1.2.8</a>). We should therefore not be discouraged just because we cannot go to the forest and practice severe austerities. Our life is so short that we must strictly adhere to the principles laid down by the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> and peacefully execute K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. There is no need to become despondent. Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura recommends: <span class="Italic">&#257;nande bala hari, bhaja v&#7771;nd&#257;vana, &#347;ri-guru-vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-pade maj&#257;iy&#257; mana.</span> For a transcendental, blissful life, chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> come worship the holy place of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, and always engage in the service of the Lord, of the spiritual master and of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore very safe and easy. We have only to execute the order of the Lord and fully surrender unto Him. We have only to execute the order of the spiritual master, preach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and follow in the path of the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. The spiritual master represents both Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas; therefore by following the instructions of the spiritual master and by chanting Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, everything will be all right.</div>

When the <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> who worships, the living entity, thinks of becoming one with the Supreme person, he simply becomes bewildered and falls into the darkness of ignorance. As stated by Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/12?d=1">2.12</a>), all living entities assembled in the battlefield, as well as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself, were also present in the past as individuals and would continue to be present in the future as individuals also. Therefore the two <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;as,</span> the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never lose their respective identities.</div>

<div class="Purport">Actually, one who is self-realized engages himself in the service of the Lord perpetually, both in this life and in the next. Indeed, for devotees there is no difference between this life and the next. In this life a neophyte devotee is trained to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in the next life he approaches that Supreme Person in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha and renders the same devotional service. Even for the neophyte devotee, devotional service is considered <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;y&#257;ya kalpate.</span> Devotional service to the Lord is never considered a material activity. Since he is acting on the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> platform, a devotee is already liberated. He therefore has no need to practice any other type of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> in order to approach the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage.

<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&#241;car&#257;tra,</span> devotional service to the Lord is likened unto a queen. When a queen gives an audience, many maidservants follow her. The maidservants of devotional service are material opulence, liberation and mystic powers. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are very much attached to material enjoyment, the <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are very anxious to become freed from material clutches, and the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are very fond of attaining the eight kinds of mystic perfection. From the <span class="Italic">N&#257;rada-pa&#241;car&#257;tra</span> we understand that if one attains the stage of pure devotional service, he also attains all the opulences derived from fruitive activities, empiric philosophical speculation and mystic yogic practice. &#346;r&#299;la Bilvama&#7749;gala &#7788;h&#257;kura therefore prayed in his <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-kar&#7751;&#257;m&#7771;ta:</span> &ldquo;My dear Lord, if I have unflinching devotion to You, You become manifest before me personally, and the results of fruitive activity and empiric philosophical speculation&mdash;namely religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation&mdash;become like personal attendants and remain standing before me as if awaiting my order.&rdquo; The idea here is that the <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> by culture of <span class="Italic">brahma-vidy&#257;,</span> spiritual knowledge, struggle very hard to get out of the clutches of material nature, but a devotee, by dint of his advancement in devotional service, automatically becomes detached from his material body.

<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura gives the following example: If one has strong digestive power, after eating he automatically lights a fire within his stomach to digest everything and does not need to take medicine to aid his digestion. Similarly, the fire of devotional service is so strong that a devotee does not need to act separately to attain perfect knowledge or detachment from material attractions. A <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;</span> may become detached from material attractions by prolonged discussions on subjects of knowledge and may in this way finally come to the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage, but a devotee does not have to undergo so much trouble.

<div class="After-Verse">Real <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;na</span> means understanding that the living entity is the eternal servant of the Lord. This knowledge is attained after many, many births, as confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/19?d=1">7.19</a>): <span class="Italic">bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; janman&#257;m ante j&#241;&#257;nav&#257;n m&#257;&#7745; prapadyate.</span> In the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage of life, one fully realizes K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as everything: <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti sa mah&#257;tm&#257; sudurlabha&#7717;.</span> When one understands fully that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is everything and that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is the highest perfection of life, he becomes a <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> or <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;.</span> Such a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;</span> or <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> is very rare to find. A <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa,</span> or pure devotee, is never attracted by <span class="Italic">ha&#7789;ha-yoga</span> or speculative knowledge. He is simply interested in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. Sometimes one who was formerly addicted to these processes tries to perform devotional service and the <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practices at the same time, but as soon as one comes to the unalloyed stage of devotional service, he is able to give up all other methods of self-realization. In other words, when one firmly realizes K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the supreme goal, he is no longer attracted by mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice or the speculative empirical methods of knowledge.</div>

<div class="First">According to a Bengali proverb, whatever spiritual progress one makes in life will be tested at the time of death. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/8/6?d=1">8.6</a>) it is also confirmed: <span class="Italic">ya&#7745; ya&#7745; v&#257;pi smaran bh&#257;va&#7745; tyajaty ante kalevaram/ ta&#7745; tam evaiti kaunteya sad&#257; tad-bh&#257;va-bh&#257;vita&#7717;.</span> Those who are practicing K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness know that their examination will be held at the time of death. If one can remember K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at death, he is immediately transferred to Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka, and thus his life becomes successful. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, could understand that the end of his life was near, and thus he became very jubilant and proceeded to completely give up his body on the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage by practicing the yogic process. It is thoroughly described in the following verses how one can voluntarily give up this body and return home, back to Godhead. The yogic process practiced by P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja at the time of death accelerates the giving up of this body while one is in sound health physically and mentally. Every devotee desires to give up the body while it is sound physically and mentally. This desire was also expressed by King Kula&#347;ekhara in his <span class="Italic">Mukunda-m&#257;l&#257;-stotra:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">King Kula&#347;ekhara wanted to give up his body while in a healthy state, and he thus prayed to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to let him die immediately while he was in good health and while his mind was sound. When a man dies, he is generally overpowered by mucus and bile, and thus he chokes. Since it is very difficult to vibrate any sound while choking, it is simply by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s grace that one can chant Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a at the time of death. However, by situating oneself in the <span class="Italic">mukt&#257;sana</span> position, a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can immediately give up his body and go to whatever planet he desires. A perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can give up his body whenever he desires through the practice of <span class="Italic">yoga.</span></div>

However, intelligent <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> do not wish to waste their time within this material world at all; they do not care for the material facilities in higher planetary systems, but are interested in going directly to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Purport">From the description in this verse, it appears that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu had no desire to promote himself to the higher planetary systems. He wanted to return home immediately, back to Godhead.

The aim of this particular system of <span class="Italic">&#257;sana,</span> known as the sitting posture for liberation, or <span class="Italic">mukt&#257;sana,</span> is to attain success in <span class="Italic">ku&#7751;&#7693;alin&#299;-cakra</span> and gradually raise the life from the <span class="Italic">m&#363;l&#257;dh&#257;ra-cakra</span> to the <span class="Italic">sv&#257;dhi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;na-cakra,</span> then to the <span class="Italic">ma&#7751;ip&#363;ra-cakra,</span> the <span class="Italic">an&#257;hata-cakra,</span> the <span class="Italic">vi&#347;uddha-cakra,</span> and finally to the <span class="Italic">&#257;j&#241;&#257;-cakra.</span> When the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> reaches the <span class="Italic">&#257;j&#241;&#257;-cakra,</span> between the two eyebrows, he is able to penetrate the <span class="Italic">brahma-randhra,</span> or the hole in his skull, and go to any planet he desires, up to the spiritual kingdom of Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka. The conclusion is that one has to come to the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage for going back to Godhead. However, those who are in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, or who are practicing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> (<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; smara&#7751;a&#7745; p&#257;da-sevanam </I>[SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/23-24?d=1">7.5.23</a>]), can return to Godhead without even practicing the <span class="Italic">mukt&#257;sana</span> process. The purpose of <span class="Italic">mukt&#257;sana</span> practice is to come to the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage, for without being on the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage, one cannot be promoted to the spiritual sky.

<div class="First">When the spiritual spark, which is described as one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, is forced into material existence, that spark is covered by gross and subtle material elements. The material body is composed of five gross elements&mdash;earth, water, fire, air and ether&mdash;and three subtle elements&mdash;mind, intelligence and ego. When one attains liberation, he is freed from these material coverings. Indeed, success in <span class="Italic">yoga</span> involves getting free from these material coverings and entering into spiritual existence. Lord Buddha&rsquo;s teachings of <span class="Italic">nirv&#257;&#7751;a</span> are based on this principle. Lord Buddha instructed his followers to give up these material coverings by means of meditation and <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> Lord Buddha did not give any information about the soul, but if one follows his instructions strictly, he will ultimately become free from the material coverings and attain <span class="Italic">nirv&#257;&#7751;a.</span></div>
<A NAME="59854"></A><div id="59854"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When a living entity gives up the material coverings, he remains a spirit soul. This spirit soul must enter into the spiritual sky to merge into the Brahman effulgence. Unfortunately, unless the living entity has information of the spiritual world and the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has, there is a 99.9 percent chance of his falling down again into material existence. There is, however, a small chance of being promoted to a spiritual planet from the Brahman effulgence, or the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> This <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is considered by impersonalists to be without variety, and the Buddhists consider it to be void. In either case, whether one accepts the spiritual sky as being without variety or void, there is none of the spiritual bliss which is enjoyed in the spiritual planets, the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;has or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka. In the absence of varieties of enjoyment, the spirit soul gradually feels an attraction to enjoy a life of bliss, and not having any information of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka or Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka, he naturally falls down to material activities in order to enjoy material varieties.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse two words are very important: <span class="Italic">yath&#257;-sth&#257;na&#7745; vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;.</span> In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> Second Canto, Fifth Chapter, Lord Brahm&#257; clearly explained to N&#257;rada how the creation took place, and he explained one step after another the proper divisions of the senses, the controller of the senses, the objects of the senses, and the material elements, and he also explained how they are created one after another: the air from the sky, the fire from the air, the water from the fire, the earth from the water, etc. It is important to know thoroughly the process of creation as it applies to this cosmic manifestation. Similarly, this body is also created according to the same process by the Supreme Lord. The Personality of Godhead, after entering the universe, creates the cosmic manifestations one after another. Similarly, the living entity, after entering a womb of a mother, also collects his gross and subtle bodies, taking ingredients from the totality of sky, air, fire, water and earth. The words <span class="Italic">yath&#257;-sth&#257;na&#7745; vibh&#257;ga&#347;a&#7717;</span> indicate that one should know the process of creation and should meditate upon the creative process inversely and thus become free from material contamination.</div>

<div class="First">In respect to the ego, the total material energy is sundered in two parts&mdash;one agitated by the mode of ignorance and the other agitated by the modes of passion and goodness. Due to agitation by the mode of ignorance, the five gross elements are created. Due to agitation by the mode of passion, the mind is created, and due to agitation by the mode of goodness, false egoism, or identification with matter, is created. The mind is protected by a particular type of demigod. Sometimes the mind (<span class="Italic">mana&#7717;</span>) is also understood to have a controlling deity or demigod. In this way the total mind, namely the material mind controlled by material demigods, was amalgamated with the senses. The senses, in turn, were amalgamated with the sense objects. The sense objects are forms, tastes, smells, sounds, etc. Sound is the ultimate source of the sense objects. The mind was attracted by the senses and the senses by the sense objects, and all of them were ultimately amalgamated in the sky. The creation is so arranged that cause and effect follow one after the other. The merging process involves amalgamating the effect with the original cause. Since the ultimate cause in the material world is <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> everything was gradually wound up and amalgamated with the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva.</span> This may be compared to <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;nya-v&#257;da,</span> or voidism, but this is the process for cleansing the real spiritual mind, or consciousness.</div>
<A NAME="59881"></A><div id="59881"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When the mind is completely washed of all material contamination, the pure consciousness acts. The sound vibration from the spiritual sky can automatically cleanse all material contaminations, as confirmed by Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: <span class="Italic">ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam</I> [Cc. Antya </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/antya/20/12?d=1">20.12</a></I>]</I>.</span> We need only take the advice of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu and chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> to cleanse the mind of all material contamination, and this may be considered the summary of this difficult verse. As soon as the whole material contamination is washed away by this process of chanting, all desires and reactions to material activities become immediately vanquished, and real life, peaceful existence, begins. In this age of Kali it is very difficult to adopt the yogic process mentioned in this verse. Unless one is very expert in such <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> the best course is to adopt the ways and means of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#299;-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtanam.</span> Thus one can gloriously become freed from all material contamination by the simple process of chanting Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. Just as life in this material world has its beginning in material sound, similarly a spiritual life has its beginning in this spiritual sound vibration.</div>

<div class="First">As stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the source of material energy.

<div class="Purport">When P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja became spiritually powerful by the enhancement of his spiritual knowledge (<span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;na</span>) and renunciation of material desires, he became a <span class="Italic">prabhu,</span> or master of his senses (sometimes called <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;).</span> This means that he was no longer controlled by the influence of material energy. When one is strong enough to give up the influence of material energy, he is called <span class="Italic">prabhu.</span> In this verse the word <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa-stha&#7717;</span> is also very significant. The real identity of the individual soul lies in understanding or attaining the knowledge that he is eternally a servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

The word <span class="Italic">p&#257;da</span> means &ldquo;position,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">Prabhup&#257;da</span> indicates that he is given the position of <span class="Italic">prabhu,</span> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Since P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a power incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <span class="Italic">&#347;akty&#257;ve&#347;a-avat&#257;ra,</span> why did he have to execute the regulative principles in order to become a <span class="Italic">prabhu</span>? Because he appeared on this earth as an ideal king and because it is the duty of the king to instruct the citizens in the execution of devotional service, he followed all the regulative principles of devotional service in order to teach others. Similarly, Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, although K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself, taught us how to approach K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a devotee. It is said, <span class="Italic">&#257;pani &#257;cari&rsquo; bhakti &#347;ikh&#257;inu sab&#257;re.</span> Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu instructed others in the process of devotional service by setting the example Himself through His own personal actions.

<div class="Translation">The Queen, the wife of P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, whose name was Arci, followed her husband into the forest. Since she was a queen, her body was very delicate.

<div class="First">Because P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s wife was the Queen and also a daughter of a king, she never experienced walking on the ground, for queens used to never come out of the palace. They certainly never went to the forests and tolerated all the difficulties of living in the wilderness. In Vedic civilization there are hundreds of similar examples of such renunciation on the part of queens and dedication to the husband. The goddess of fortune mother S&#299;t&#257; followed her husband, R&#257;macandra, when He went to the forest. Lord R&#257;macandra went to the forest in compliance with the order of His father, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, but mother S&#299;t&#257; was not so ordered. Nonetheless, she voluntarily accepted the path of her husband. Similarly, G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;, the wife of King Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, also followed her husband into the forest. Being the wives of great personalities like P&#7771;thu, Lord R&#257;macandra and Dh&#7771;tar&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, these were ideal chaste women. Such queens also instructed the general people by showing them how to become a chaste wife and follow the husband in every stage of life. When the husband is king, she sits beside him as the queen, and when he goes to the forest, she also follows, despite having to tolerate all kinds of difficulties in living in the forest. Therefore it is said here (<span class="Italic">atad-arh&#257;</span>) that although she did not want to touch her feet to the ground, she nonetheless accepted all difficulties when she went to the forest with her husband.</div>

<div class="First">The words <span class="Italic">bhartur vrata-dharma-ni&#7779;&#7789;hay&#257;</span> indicate that a woman&rsquo;s duty, or religious principle, is to serve her husband in all conditions. In Vedic civilization a man is taught from the beginning of his life to become a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> then an ideal <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> then <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> then <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> and the wife is taught just to follow the husband strictly in all conditions of life. After the period of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya,</span> a man accepts a householder&rsquo;s life, and the woman is also taught by her parents to be a chaste wife. Thus when a girl and boy are united, both are trained for a life dedicated to a higher purpose. The boy is trained to execute his duty in accordance with the higher purpose of life, and the girl is trained to follow him. The chaste wife&rsquo;s duty is to keep her husband pleased in householder life in all respects, and when the husband retires from family life, she is to go to the forest and adopt the life of <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha,</span> or <span class="Italic">vana-v&#257;s&#299;.</span> At that time the wife is to follow her husband and take care of him, just as she took care of him in householder life. But when the husband takes the renounced order of life, namely <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the wife is to return home and become a saintly woman, setting an example for her children and daughters-in-law and showing them how to live a life of austerity.</div>
<A NAME="59929"></A><div id="59929"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu took <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> His wife, Vi&#7779;&#7751;upriy&#257;dev&#299;, although only sixteen years old, also took the vow of austerity due to her husband&rsquo;s leaving home. She chanted her beads, and after finishing one round, she collected one grain of rice. In this way, as many rounds as she chanted, she would receive the same number of rice grains and then cook them and so take <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da.</span> This is called austerity. Even today in India, widows or women whose husbands have taken <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> follow the principles of austerity, even though they live with their children. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s wife, Arci, was steadily determined to execute the duty of a wife, and while her husband was in the forest, she followed him in eating only fruits and leaves and lying down on the ground. Since a woman&rsquo;s body is considerably more delicate than a man&rsquo;s, Queen Arci became very frail and thin, <span class="Italic">parikar&#347;it&#257;.</span> When one engages in austerities, his body generally becomes lean and thin. Becoming fat is not a very good qualification in spiritual life because a person who is engaged in spiritual life must reduce the comforts of the body&mdash;namely eating, sleeping and mating&mdash;to a minimum. Although Queen Arci became very thin from living in the forest according to regulative principles, she was not unhappy, for she was enjoying the honor of serving her great husband.</div>

The Queen should have been afraid of being alone in the forest with the body of her husband, but since she was a great wife of a great personality, she lamented for a while but immediately understood that she had many duties to perform. Thus instead of wasting her time in lamentation, she immediately prepared a fiery pyre on top of a hill and then placed the body of her husband on it to be burned.</div>

This practice is also followed by the wives of the demigods, and in days past the wives of men also followed this same principle. In Vedic civilization the husband and wife were not separated by such man-made laws as divorce. We should understand the necessity for maintaining family life in human society and should thus abolish this artificial law known as divorce. The husband and wife should live in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and follow in the footsteps of Lak&#7779;m&#299;-N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-Rukmi&#7751;&#299;.

Although they were the wives of the denizens of the higher planetary system and P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was an inhabitant of an inferior planetary system (the earth), the King, along with his wife, passed beyond the realms of the demigods and went upward to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. The word <span class="Italic">&#363;rdhvam</span> (&ldquo;upward&rdquo;) is significant here, for the ladies speaking were from the higher planetary systems, which include the moon, sun and Venus, up to Brahmaloka, or the highest planet. Beyond Brahmaloka is the spiritual sky, and in that spiritual sky there are innumerable Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. Thus the word <span class="Italic">&#363;rdhvam</span> indicates that the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets are beyond or above these material planets, and it was to these Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets that P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and his wife were going. This also indicates that when P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and his wife, Arci, abandoned their material bodies in the material fire, they immediately developed their spiritual bodies and entered into spiritual airplanes, which could penetrate the material elements and reach the spiritual sky. Since they were carried by two separate airplanes, it may be concluded that even after being burned in the funeral pyre they remained separate, individual persons. In other words, they never lost their identity or became void, as imagined by the impersonalists.</div>

<div class="Purport">The ladies in the higher planetary systems were capable of seeing both downward and upward. When they looked down they could see that the body of P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was being burned and that his wife, Arci, was entering into the fire, and when they looked upward they could see how they were being carried in two airplanes to the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. All of this is possible simply by <span class="Italic">durvibh&#257;vyena karma&#7751;&#257;,</span> inconceivable activity. P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was a pure devotee, and his wife, Queen Arci, simply followed her husband. Thus they can both be considered pure devotees, and thus they are capable of performing inconceivable activities. Such activities are not possible for ordinary men. Indeed, ordinary men cannot even take to the devotional service of the Lord, nor can ordinary women maintain such vows of chastity and follow their husbands in all respects. A woman does not need to attain high qualifications, but if she simply follows in the footsteps of her husband, who must be a devotee, then both husband and wife attain liberation and are promoted to the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas. This is evinced by the inconceivable activities of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu and his wife.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/33?d=1">9.33</a>) Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says: <span class="Italic">anityam asukha&#7745; lokam ima&#7745; pr&#257;pya bhajasva m&#257;m.</span> The Lord here declares that this material world is full of miseries (<span class="Italic">asukham</span>) and at the same time is very flickering (<span class="Italic">anityam</span>). Therefore one&rsquo;s only duty is to engage himself in devotional service. This is the best end to which human life can be put. Those devotees who are constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord achieve not only all material benefits but also all spiritual benefits, for at the end of life they go back home, back to Godhead. Their destination is described in this verse as <span class="Italic">bhagavat-padam.</span> The word <span class="Italic">padam</span> means &ldquo;abode,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">bhagavat</span> means &ldquo;the Supreme Personality of Godhead.&rdquo; Thus the destination of the devotees is the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="60023"></A><div id="60023"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;karmyam,</span> which means &ldquo;transcendental knowledge,&rdquo; is also significant. Unless one comes to the platform of transcendental knowledge and offers devotional service to the Lord, one is not perfect. Generally the processes of <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;na, yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">karma</span> are executed life after life before one gets a chance to render pure devotional service to the Lord. This chance is given by the grace of a pure devotee, and it is in this way only that one can actually attain liberation. In the context of this narration, the wives of the demigods repented because although they had the opportunity of a birth in a higher planetary system, a lifetime spanning millions of years and all material comforts, they were not as fortunate as P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and his wife, who were actually surpassing them. In other words, P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and his wife scorned promotion to the higher planetary systems and even to Brahmaloka because the position which they were attaining was incomparable. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/8/16?d=1">8.16</a>) the Lord affirms, <span class="Italic">&#257;brahma-bhuvan&#257;l lok&#257;&#7717; punar &#257;vartino &rsquo;rjuna:</span> &ldquo;From the highest planet in the material world to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.&rdquo; In other words, even if one goes to the highest planet, Brahmaloka, he has to return to the miseries of birth and death. In the Ninth Chapter of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/21?d=1">9.21</a>), Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a also asserts:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;When they have thus enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they return to this mortal planet again.&rdquo; Thus after exhausting the results of pious activities, one has to come again to the lower planetary systems and begin a new chapter of pious activities. It is therefore said in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/5/12?d=1">1.5.12</a>), <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;karmyam apy acyuta-bh&#257;va-varjitam:</span> &ldquo;The path of liberation is not at all secure unless one attains the devotional service of the Lord.&rdquo; Even if one is promoted to the impersonal <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> he runs every chance of falling down into this material world. If it is possible to fall down from the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> which is beyond the higher planetary systems in this material world, then what can be said of the ordinary <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> who can only be elevated to the higher material planets? Thus the wives of the denizens of the higher planetary systems did not very much appreciate the results of <span class="Italic">karma, j&#241;&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga.</span></div>

<div class="First">In this material world people are engaged in different activities simply to achieve a little success in sense gratification. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are engaged in performing very difficult activities, and thus they open gigantic factories, build huge cities, make big scientific discoveries, etc. In other words, they are engaged in performing very costly sacrifices in order to be promoted to the higher planetary systems. Similarly, <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are engaged in achieving a similar goal by accepting the tedious practices of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> <span class="Italic">J&#241;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are engaged in philosophical speculation in order to gain release from the clutches of material nature. In these ways everyone is engaged in performing very difficult tasks simply for the gratification of the senses. All of these are considered to be engaged in sense gratificatory activities (or <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;aya</span>) because they all demand some facility for material existence. Actually the results of such activities are temporary. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself proclaims in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/23?d=1">7.23</a>), <span class="Italic">antavat tu phala&#7745; te&#7779;&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;The fruits [of those who worship the demigods] are limited and temporary.&rdquo; Thus the fruits of the activities of the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s, karm&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are ephemeral. Moreover, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">tad bhavaty alpa-medhas&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;They are simply meant for men of small intelligence.&rdquo; The word <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;aya</span> denotes sense gratification. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> flatly state that they want sense gratification. The <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> also want sense gratification, but they want it to a higher degree. It is their desire to show some miraculous results through the practice of <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> Thus they strive very hard to achieve success in becoming smaller than the smallest or greater than the greatest, or in creating a planet like earth or, as scientists, by inventing so many wonderful machines. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are also engaged in sense gratification, for they are simply interested in becoming one with the Supreme. Thus the aim of all these activities is sense gratification to a higher or a lower degree. The <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> however, are not interested in sense gratificatory practices; they are simply satisfied to get an opportunity to serve the Lord. Although they are satisfied in any condition, there is nothing they cannot obtain, because they are purely engaged in the service of the Lord.</div>

In the human form of life one can obtain the guidance of a good navigator, the spiritual master. One also gets a favorable wind by the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and that wind is the instructions of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The human body is the boat, the instructions of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a are the favorable winds, and the spiritual master is the navigator. The spiritual master knows well how to adjust the sails to catch the winds favorably and steer the boat to its destination.

There are five kinds of liberation, and one is called <span class="Italic">s&#257;yujya-mukti,</span> or merging into the existence of the Supreme, or the impersonal Brahman effulgence. However, since there is a chance of one&rsquo;s falling down again into the material sky from the Brahman effulgence, &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; advises that in this human form of life one&rsquo;s only aim should be to go back home, back to Godhead. The words <span class="Italic">sa va&#241;cita&#7717;</span> indicate that once a person has obtained the human form of life, he is actually cheated if he does not make preparations to go back home, back to Godhead. The position of all nondevotees, who are not interested in going back to Godhead, is very much lamentable, for the human form of life is meant for executing devotional service and nothing else.</div>

<div class="First">According to Vedic scriptures, a woman who dies with her husband, or enters into the fire in which her husband is burning, also enters the same planet her husband attains. In this material world there is a planet known as Patiloka, just as there is a planet known as Pit&#7771;loka. But in this verse the word <span class="Italic">pati-loka</span> does not refer to any planet within this material universe, for P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, being topmost amongst self-realized souls, certainly returned home, back to Godhead, and attained one of the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. Queen Arci also entered Patiloka, but this planet is not in the material universe, for she actually entered the planet which her husband attained. In the material world also, when a woman dies with her husband, she again unites with him in the next birth. Similarly, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu and Queen Arci united in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. In the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets there are husbands and wives, but there is no question of their giving birth to children or having sex life. In the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets both husbands and wives are extraordinarily beautiful, and they are attracted to one another, but they do not enjoy sex life. Indeed, they consider sex not to be very relishable because both husband and wife are always absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and in glorifying and chanting the glories of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="60057"></A><div id="60057"> </div>
<div class="Purport">According to Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura also, a husband and wife can turn the home into a place as good as Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, even while in this material world. Being absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, even in this world husband and wife can live in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha simply by installing the Deity of the Lord within the home and serving the Deity according to the directions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> In this way, they will never feel the sex urge. That is the test of advancement in devotional service. One who is advanced in devotional service is never attracted by sex life, and as soon as one becomes detached from sex life and proportionately attached to the service of the Lord, he actually experiences living in the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. In the ultimate issue, there is actually no material world, but when one forgets the service of the Lord and engages himself in the service of his senses, he is said to be living in the material world.</div>

The fact is explained herein that hearing and chanting about a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is as good as hearing and chanting about Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, for Maitreya has explained that anyone who hears about P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja with attention also attains the planet which Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu attained.

It is also stated by the Lord Himself that devotional service to His devotees is better than service offered directly to Him. Sometimes the <span class="Italic">sahajiy&#257;</span> class of devotees are interested only in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s personal pastimes to the exclusion of the activities of the devotees. This type of devotee is not on a very high level; one who sees the devotee and the Lord on the same level has further progressed.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> it is recommended that one should become a devotee regardless of one&rsquo;s condition.

By so doing, one attains all perfection in any field of life.

This cosmic manifestation, which is compared to an ocean of nescience, is also resting on the lotus feet of the Lord. As such, this great ocean of nescience is minimized by a person who is a pure devotee. One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord need not cross over the ocean, for he has already crossed it by virtue of his position at the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. By hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord or the Lord&rsquo;s devotee, one can become firmly fixed in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. This position can also be achieved very easily by narrating the history of the life of P&#7771;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja regularly every day. The word <span class="Italic">vimukta-sa&#7749;ga&#7717;</span> is also significant in this connection. Because we associate with the three qualities of material nature, our position in this material world is full of dangers, but when we engage in the devotional service of the Lord by the process of <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;am</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#299;rtanam,</span> we immediately become <span class="Italic">vimukta-sa&#7749;ga,</span> or liberated.</div>
