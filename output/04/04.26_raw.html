<div class="Translation">The great sage N&#257;rada continued: My dear King, once upon a time King Pura�jana took up his great bow, and equipped with golden armor and a quiver of unlimited arrows and accompanied by eleven commanders, he sat on his chariot driven by five swift horses and went to the forest named Pa�ca-prastha. He took with him in that chariot two explosive arrows. The chariot itself was situated on two wheels and one revolving axle. On the chariot were three flags, one rein, one chariot driver, one sitting place, two poles to which the harness was fixed, five weapons and seven coverings. The chariot moved in five different styles, and five obstacles lay before it. All the decorations of the chariot were made of gold.</div>

<A NAME="62267"></A><div id="62267"> </div>
<div class="First">These three verses explain how the material body of the living entity is under the control of the three qualities of the external energy. The body itself is the chariot, and the living entity is the owner of the body, as explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/13?d=1">2.13</a>): <span class="Italic">dehino &rsquo;smin yath&#257; dehe.</span> The owner of the body is called the <span class="Italic">deh&#299;,</span> and he is situated within this body, specifically within the heart. The living entity is driven by one chariot driver. The chariot itself is made of three <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;as,</span> three qualities of material nature, as confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/61?d=1">18.61</a>): <span class="Italic">yantr&#257;r&#363;&#7693;h&#257;ni m&#257;yay&#257;.</span> The word <span class="Italic">yantra</span> means &ldquo;carriage.&rdquo; The body is given by material nature, and the driver of that body is Param&#257;tm&#257;, the Supersoul. The living entity is seated within the chariot. This is the actual position.</div>
<A NAME="62268"></A><div id="62268"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The living entity is always being influenced by the three qualities&mdash;<span class="Italic">sattva</span> (goodness), <span class="Italic">rajas</span> (passion) and <span class="Italic">tamas</span> (ignorance). This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/13?d=1">7.13</a>). <span class="Italic">Tribhir gu&#7751;amayair bh&#257;vai&#7717;:</span> the living entity is bewildered by the three qualities of material nature. These three qualities are described in this verse as three flags. By a flag, one can come to know who the owner of the chariot is; similarly, by the influence of the three qualities of material nature, one can easily know the direction in which the chariot is moving. In other words, one who has eyes to see can understand how the body is being driven, influenced by the particular type of quality of material nature. In these three verses the activity of the living entity is described to prove how the body becomes influenced by the quality of ignorance, even when a person wants to be religious. N&#257;rada Muni wanted to prove to King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at that the King was being influenced by the <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> the quality of ignorance, even though the King was supposed to be very religious.</div>
<A NAME="62269"></A><div id="62269"> </div>
<div class="Purport">According to <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya,</span> the process of fruitive activities, a person performs various sacrifices directed by the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and in all those sacrifices animal-killing, or experimenting on the life of animals to test the power of Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras,</span> is enjoined. Animal-killing is certainly conducted under the influence of the mode of ignorance. Even though one may be religiously inclined, animal sacrifice is recommended in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> not only in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> but even in the modern scriptures of other sects. These animal sacrifices are recommended in the name of religion, but actually animal sacrifice is meant for persons in the mode of ignorance. When such people kill animals, they can at least do so in the name of religion. However, when the religious system is transcendental, like the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava religion, there is no place for animal sacrifice. Such a transcendental religious system is recommended by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/66?d=1">18.66</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.&rdquo; Because King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at was engaged in performing various sacrifices in which animals were killed, N&#257;rada Muni pointed out that such sacrifices are influenced by the mode of ignorance. From the very beginning of <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/2?d=1">1.1.2</a>) it is said: <span class="Italic">projjhita-kaitavo &rsquo;tra.</span> All kinds of religious systems that are involved in cheating are completely kicked out of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">bhagavad-dharma,</span> the religion dealing with one&rsquo;s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, animal sacrifice is not recommended. In the performance of <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj�a</span>&mdash;Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare&mdash;there is no recommendation for animal sacrifices.</div>
<A NAME="62272"></A><div id="62272"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In these three verses, King Pura�jana&rsquo;s going to the forest to kill animals is symbolic of the living entity&rsquo;s being driven by the mode of ignorance and thus engaging in different activities for sense gratification. The material body itself indicates that the living entity is already influenced by the three modes of material nature and that he is driven to enjoy material resources. When the body is influenced by the mode of ignorance, its infection becomes very acute. When it is influenced by the mode of passion, the infection is at the symptomatic stage. However, when the body is influenced by the mode of goodness, the materialistic infection becomes purified. The ritualistic ceremonies recommended in religious systems are certainly on the platform of goodness, but because within this material world even the mode of goodness is sometimes polluted by the other qualities (namely passion and ignorance), a man in goodness is sometimes driven by the influence of ignorance.</div>
<A NAME="62273"></A><div id="62273"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is herein described that King Pura�jana once went to the forest to kill animals. This means that he, the living entity, came under the influence of the mode of ignorance. The forest in which King Pura�jana engaged in hunting was named Pa�ca-prastha. The word <span class="Italic">pa�ca</span> means &ldquo;five,&rdquo; and this indicates the objects of the five senses. The body has five working senses, namely the hands, the legs, the tongue, the rectum and the genitals. By taking full advantage of these working senses, the body enjoys material life. The chariot is driven by five horses, which represent the five sense organs&mdash;namely the eyes, ears, nose, skin and tongue. These sense organs are very easily attracted by the sense objects. Consequently, the horses are described as moving swiftly. On the chariot King Pura�jana kept two explosive weapons, which may be compared to <span class="Italic">aha&#7749;k&#257;ra,</span> or false ego. This false ego is typified by two attitudes: &ldquo;I am this body&rdquo; (<span class="Italic">ahant&#257;</span>), and &ldquo;Everything in my bodily relationships belongs to me&rdquo; (<span class="Italic">mamat&#257;</span>).</div>
<A NAME="62274"></A><div id="62274"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The two wheels of the chariot may be compared to the two moving facilities&mdash;namely sinful life and religious life. The chariot is decorated with three flags, which represent the three modes of material nature. The five kinds of obstacles, or uneven roads, represent the five kinds of air passing within the body. These are <span class="Italic">pr&#257;&#7751;a, ap&#257;na, ud&#257;na, sam&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">vy&#257;na.</span> The body itself is covered by seven coverings, namely skin, muscle, fat, blood, marrow, bone and semen. The living entity is covered by three subtle material elements and five gross material elements. These are actually obstacles placed before the living entity on the path of liberation from material bondage.</div>
<A NAME="62275"></A><div id="62275"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">ra&#347;mi</span> (&ldquo;rope&rdquo;) in this verse indicates the mind. The word <span class="Italic">n&#299;&#7693;a</span> is also significant, for <span class="Italic">n&#299;&#7693;a</span> indicates the nest where a bird takes rest. In this case <span class="Italic">n&#299;&#7693;a</span> is the heart, where the living entity is situated. The living entity sits in one place only. The causes of his bondage are two: namely lamentation and illusion. In material existence the living entity simply hankers to get something he can never get. Therefore he is in illusion. As a result of being in this illusory situation, the living entity is always lamenting. Thus lamentation and illusion are described herein as <span class="Italic">dvi-k&#363;bara,</span> the two posts of bondage.</div>
<A NAME="62276"></A><div id="62276"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The living entity carries out various desires through five different processes, which indicate the working of the five working senses. The golden ornaments and dress indicate that the living entity is influenced by the quality of <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a,</span> passion. One who has a good deal of money or riches is especially driven by the mode of passion. Being influenced by the mode of passion, one desires so many things for enjoyment in this material world. The eleven commanders represent the ten senses and the mind. The mind is always making plans with the ten commanders to enjoy the material world. The forest named Pa�ca-prastha, where the King went to hunt, is the forest of the five sense objects: form, taste, sound, smell and touch. Thus in these three verses N&#257;rada Muni describes the position of the material body and the encagement of the living entity within it.</div>

<div class="Translation">It was almost impossible for King Pura�jana to give up the company of his Queen even for a moment. Nonetheless, on that day, being very much inspired by the desire to hunt, he took up his bow and arrow with great pride and went to the forest, not caring for his wife.</div>
<A NAME="62288"></A><div id="62288"> </div>

<A NAME="62289"></A><div id="62289"> </div>
<div class="First">One form of hunting is known as woman-hunting. A conditioned soul is never satisfied with one wife. Those whose senses are very much uncontrolled especially try to hunt for many women. King Pura�jana&rsquo;s abandoning the company of his religiously married wife is representative of the conditioned soul&rsquo;s attempt to hunt for many women for sense gratification. Wherever a king goes, he is supposed to be accompanied by his queen, but when the king, or conditioned soul, becomes greatly overpowered by the desire for sense gratification, he does not care for religious principles. Instead, with great pride, he accepts the bow and arrow of attachment and hatred. Our consciousness is always working in two ways&mdash;the right way and the wrong way. When one becomes too proud of his position, influenced by the mode of passion, he gives up the right path and accepts the wrong one. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;atriya</span> kings are sometimes advised to go to the forest to hunt ferocious animals just to learn how to kill, but such forays are never meant for sense gratification. Killing animals to eat their flesh is forbidden for human beings.</div>

<div class="First">When a man becomes too proud of his material position, he tries to enjoy his senses in an unrestricted way, being influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance. He is thus described as asuric, or demoniac. When people are demoniac in spirit, they are not merciful toward the poor animals. Consequently, they maintain various animal slaughterhouses. This is technically called <span class="Italic">s&#363;n&#257;,</span> or <span class="Italic">hi&#7745;s&#257;,</span> which means the killing of living beings. In Kali-yuga, due to the increase of the modes of passion and ignorance, almost all men are asuric, or demoniac; therefore they are very much fond of eating flesh, and for this end they maintain various kinds of animal slaughterhouses.</div>
<A NAME="62303"></A><div id="62303"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this age of Kali the propensity for mercy is almost nil. Consequently there is always fighting and wars between men and nations. Men do not understand that because they unrestrictedly kill so many animals, they also must be slaughtered like animals in big wars. This is very much evident in the Western countries. In the West, slaughterhouses are maintained without restriction, and therefore every fifth or tenth year there is a big war in which countless people are slaughtered even more cruelly than the animals. Sometimes during war, soldiers keep their enemies in concentration camps and kill them in very cruel ways. These are reactions brought about by unrestricted animal-killing in the slaughterhouse and by hunters in the forest. Proud, demoniac persons do not know the laws of nature, or the laws of God. Consequently, they unrestrictedly kill poor animals, not caring for them at all. In the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, animal-killing is completely prohibited. One is not accepted as a bona fide student in this movement unless he promises to follow the four regulative principles: no animal-killing, no intoxication, no illicit sex and no gambling. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is the only means by which the sinful activities of men in this Kali-yuga can be counteracted.</div>

<div class="Translation">If a king is too attracted to eating flesh, he may, according to the directions of the revealed scriptures on sacrificial performances, go to the forest and kill some animals that are recommended for killing. One is not allowed to kill animals unnecessarily or without restrictions. The Vedas regulate animal-killing to stop the extravagance of foolish men influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance.</div>

<div class="First">The question may be raised why a living being should be restricted in sense gratification. If a king, to learn how to kill, may go to the forest and kill animals, why should a living entity, who has been given senses, not be allowed unrestricted sense gratification? At the present moment this argument is put forward even by so-called <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> who publicly say that because we have senses we must satisfy them by sense gratification. These foolish <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> however, do not know the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> Indeed, sometimes these rascals come out to defy the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> They even publicly announce that there should be no more <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> no more books. &ldquo;Just come to me,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;and I shall touch you, and you will become immediately spiritually advanced.&rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="62317"></A><div id="62317"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Because demoniac people want to be cheated, so many cheaters are present to cheat them. At the present moment in this age of Kali-yuga, the entire human society has become an assembly of cheaters and cheated. For this reason the Vedic scriptures have given us the proper directions for sense gratification. Everyone is inclined in this age to eat meat and fish, drink liquor and indulge in sex life, but according to the Vedic injunctions, sex is allowed only in marriage, meat-eating is allowed only when the animal is killed and offered before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;, and intoxication is allowed only in a restricted way. In this verse the word <span class="Italic">niyamyate</span> indicates that all these things&mdash;namely animal-killing, intoxication and sex&mdash;should be regulated.</div>
<A NAME="62318"></A><div id="62318"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Regulations are meant for human beings, not for animals. The traffic regulations on the street, telling people to keep to the right or the left, are meant for human beings, not for animals. If an animal violates such a law, he is never punished, but a human being is punished. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are not meant for the animals, but for the understanding of human society. A person who indiscriminately violates the rules and regulations given by the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is liable to be punished. One should therefore not enjoy his senses according to his lusty desires, but should restrict himself according to the regulative principles given in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> If a king is allowed to hunt in a forest, it is not for his sense gratification. We cannot simply experiment in the art of killing. If a king, being afraid to meet rogues and thieves, kills poor animals and eats their flesh comfortably at home, he must lose his position. Because in this age kings have such demoniac propensities, monarchy is abolished by the laws of nature in every country.</div>
<A NAME="62319"></A><div id="62319"> </div>
<div class="Purport">People have become so degraded in this age that on the one hand they restrict polygamy and on the other hand they hunt for women in so many ways. Many business concerns publicly advertise that topless girls are available in this club or in that shop. Thus women have become instruments of sense enjoyment in modern society. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> enjoin, however, that if a man has the propensity to enjoy more than one wife&mdash;as is sometimes the propensity for men in the higher social order, such as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas,</span> and even sometimes the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span>&mdash;he is allowed to marry more than one wife. Marriage means taking complete charge of a woman and living peacefully without debauchery. At the present moment, however, debauchery is unrestricted. Nonetheless, society makes a law that one should not marry more than one wife. This is typical of a demoniac society.</div>

<div class="First">Just as a government may issue trade licenses in order for its citizens to act in a certain way, the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> contain injunctions that restrain and regulate all of our fruitive activities. All living entities have come into this material world to enjoy themselves. Consequently, the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are given to regulate sense enjoyment. One who enjoys his senses under the Vedic regulative principles does not become entangled in the actions and reactions of his activities. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/9?d=1">3.9</a>), <span class="Italic">yaj�&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;a&#7717;:</span> one should act only for the performance of <span class="Italic">yaj�a,</span> or to satisfy Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. <span class="Italic">Anyatra loko &rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;:</span> otherwise any action will produce a reaction by which the living entity will be bound. A human being is especially meant to attain liberation from the bondage of birth, death, old age and disease. He is therefore directed by the Vedic regulative principles to work in such a way that he may fulfill his desires for sense gratification and at the same time gradually become freed from material bondage. Action according to such principles is called knowledge. Indeed, the word <span class="Italic">veda</span> means &ldquo;knowledge.&rdquo; The words <span class="Italic">j�&#257;nena na sa lipyate</span> indicate that by following the Vedic principles, one does not become involved in the actions and reactions of his fruitive activities.</div>

<div class="Purport">Everyone is therefore advised to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions and not irresponsibly. When a person within a state acts according to the laws and licenses of the government, he does not become involved in criminal activities. Man-made laws, however, are always defective because they are made by men who are prone to committing mistakes, being illusioned, cheating and having imperfect senses. The Vedic instructions are different because they do not have these four defects. Vedic instructions are not subject to mistakes. The knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is knowledge received directly from God, and there is consequently no question of illusion, cheating, mistakes or imperfect senses. All Vedic knowledge is perfect because it is received directly from God by the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;,</span> disciplic succession. In <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1">1.1.1</a>) it is said: <span class="Italic">tene brahma h&#7771;d&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye.</span> The original creature of this universe, known as the <span class="Italic">&#257;di-kavi,</span> or Lord Brahm&#257;, was instructed by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a through the heart. After receiving these Vedic instructions from Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself, Brahm&#257; distributed the knowledge by the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system to N&#257;rada, and N&#257;rada in turn distributed the knowledge to Vy&#257;sa. In this way Vedic knowledge is perfect. If we act according to Vedic knowledge, there is no question of being involved in sinful activities.</div>

<div class="First">When demoniac persons engage in animal-killing, the demigods, or devotees of the Lord, are very much afflicted by this killing. Demoniac civilizations in this modern age maintain various types of slaughterhouses all over the world. Rascal <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> encourage foolish persons to go on eating flesh and killing animals and at the same time continue their so-called meditation and mystical practices. All these affairs are ghastly, and a compassionate person, namely a devotee of the Lord, becomes very unhappy to see such a sight. The hunting process is also carried on in a different way, as we have already explained. Hunting women, drinking different types of liquor, becoming intoxicated, killing animals and enjoying sex all serve as the basis of modern civilization. Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas are unhappy to see such a situation in the world, and therefore they are very busy spreading this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement.</div>
<A NAME="62378"></A><div id="62378"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The devotees are pained to see the hunting and killing of animals in the forest, the wholesale slaughter of animals in the slaughterhouses, and the exploitation of young girls in brothels that function under different names as clubs and societies. Being very much compassionate upon the killing of animals in sacrifice, the great sage N&#257;rada began his instructions to King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at. In these instructions, N&#257;rada Muni explained that devotees like him are very much afflicted by all the killing that goes on in human society. Not only are saintly persons afflicted by this killing, but even God Himself is afflicted and therefore comes down in the incarnation of Lord Buddha. Jayadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; therefore sings: <span class="Italic">sadaya-h&#7771;daya-dar&#347;ita-pa&#347;u-gh&#257;tam.</span> Simply to stop the killing of animals, Lord Buddha compassionately appeared. Some rascals put forward the theory that an animal has no soul or is something like dead stone. In this way they rationalize that there is no sin in animal-killing. Actually animals are not dead stone, but the killers of animals are stonehearted. Consequently no reason or philosophy appeals to them. They continue keeping slaughterhouses and killing animals in the forest. The conclusion is that one who does not care for the instructions of saintly persons like N&#257;rada and his disciplic succession surely falls into the category of <span class="Italic">na&#7779;&#7789;a-praj�a</span> and thus goes to hell.</div>

The resultant effect of sinful life is suffering. Those who are not in knowledge, who commit violations of the standard laws, are subject to be punished under criminal laws. Similarly, the laws of nature are very stringent. If a child touches fire without knowing the effect, he must be burned, even though he is only a child. If a child violates the law of nature, there is no compassion. Only through ignorance does a person violate the laws of nature, and when he comes to knowledge he does not commit any more sinful acts.</div>

<div class="Purport">The King became tired after killing so many animals. When a man comes in contact with a saintly person, he becomes aware of the stringent laws of nature and thus becomes a religious person. Irreligious persons are like animals, but in this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement such persons can come to a sense of understanding things as they are and abandon the four principles of prohibited activities&mdash;namely illicit sex life, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. This is the beginning of religious life. Those who are so-called religious and indulge in these four principles of prohibited activities are pseudoreligionists. Religious life and sinful activity cannot parallel one another. If one is serious in accepting a religious life, or the path of salvation, he must adhere to the four basic rules and regulations. However sinful a man may be, if he receives knowledge from the proper spiritual master and repents his past activities in his sinful life and stops them, he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead. This is made possible just by following the rules and regulations given by the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> and following the bona fide spiritual master.</div>

<div class="Purport">At present the whole world is on the verge of retiring from a blind materialistic civilization, which may be likened to hunting animals in the forest. People should take advantage of this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement and leave their troublesome life of killing. It is said that the killers of animals should neither live nor die. If they live only to kill animals and enjoy women, life is not very prosperous. And as soon as a killer dies, he enters the cycle of birth and death in the lower species of life. That also is not desirable. The conclusion is that killers should retire from the killing business and take to this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement to make life perfect. A confused, frustrated man cannot get relief by committing suicide because suicide will simply lead him to take birth in the lower species of life or to remain a ghost, unable to attain a gross material body. Therefore the perfect course is to retire altogether from sinful activities and take up K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In this way one can become completely perfect and go back home, back to Godhead.</div>

When a person comes to his senses and understands how he is engaging in sinful activities, he returns to his conscience, which is herein figuratively described as the palace. Generally a materialistic person is infected by the material modes of passion and ignorance. The results of passion and ignorance are lust and greed. In the life of a materialist, activity means working in lust and greed. However, when he comes to his senses, he wants to retire. According to Vedic civilization, such retirement is positively recommended, and this portion of life is called <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha.</span> Retirement is absolutely necessary for a materialist who wants to become free from the activities of a sinful life.</div>

In this way a man becomes refreshed in mind, exactly like a person who smears scented sandalwood pulp all over his body and decorates himself with ornaments.

Therefore &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura sings: <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu-&#347;&#257;stra-guru-v&#257;kya, cittete kariy&#257; aikya.</span> If we want to become saintly persons, or if we want to return to our original K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, we must associate with <span class="Italic">s&#257;dhu</span> (a saintly person), <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stra</span> (authoritative Vedic literature) and <span class="Italic">guru</span> (a bona fide spiritual master). This is the process.</div>

<div class="First">This verse is very significant for those desiring to elevate themselves to a higher level of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. When a person is initiated by a spiritual master, he changes his habits and does not eat undesirable eatables or engage in the eating of meat, the drinking of liquor, illicit sex or gambling. <span class="Italic">S&#257;ttvika-&#257;h&#257;ra,</span> foodstuffs in the mode of goodness, are described in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> as wheat, rice, vegetables, fruits, milk, sugar, and milk products. Simple food like rice, <span class="Italic">dhal, cap&#257;t&#299;s,</span> vegetables, milk and sugar constitute a balanced diet, but sometimes it is found that an initiated person, in the name of <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da,</span> eats very luxurious foodstuffs. Due to his past sinful life he becomes attracted by Cupid and eats good food voraciously. It is clearly visible that when a neophyte in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness eats too much, he falls down. Instead of being elevated to pure K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he becomes attracted by Cupid. The so-called <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> becomes agitated by women, and the <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprastha</span> may again become captivated into having sex with his wife. Or he may begin to search out another wife. Due to some sentiment, he may give up his own wife and come into the association of devotees and a spiritual master, but due to his past sinful life he cannot stay. Instead of being elevated to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he falls down, being attracted by Cupid, and takes to another wife for sex enjoyment. The fall of the neophyte devotee from the path of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness down to material life is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/5/17?d=1">1.5.17</a>) by N&#257;rada Muni.</div>

However, a person who remains steadfast in his family duty or so-called social or family obligation but does not take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness receives no profit.

<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">vedi&#7779;at</span> indicates King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi. When a man becomes refreshed by association with devotees and awakes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he consults the activities of his mind&mdash;namely thinking, feeling and willing&mdash;and decides whether he should return to his material activities or stay steady in spiritual consciousness. The word <span class="Italic">ku&#347;alam</span> refers to that which is auspicious. One can make his home perfectly auspicious when he engages in devotional service to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. When one is engaged in activities other than <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-bhakti,</span> or in other words when one is engaged in material activities, he is always filled with anxieties. A sane man should consult his mind, its thinking, feeling and willing processes, and decide how these processes should be utilized. If one always thinks of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, feels how to serve Him and wills to execute the order of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, it should be known that he has taken good instruction from his intelligence, which is called the mother. Although the King was refreshed, he nonetheless inquired about his wife. Thus he was consulting, thinking and willing how he could return to his steady good consciousness. The mind may suggest that by <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;aya-bhoga,</span> or sense enjoyment, one can become happy, but when one becomes advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he does not derive happiness from material activities. This is explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/59?d=1">2.59</a>):</div>

<A NAME="62473"></A><div id="62473"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Actually, a woman is supposed to be the energy of the man. Historically, in the background of every great man there is either a mother or a wife. One&rsquo;s household life is very successful if he has both a good wife and mother. In such a case, everything about household affairs and all the paraphernalia in the house becomes very pleasing. Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu had both a good mother and pleasing wife, and He was very happy at home. Nonetheless, for the benefit of the whole human race, He took <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span> and left both His mother and wife. In other words, it is essential that one have both a good mother and wife in order to become perfectly happy at home. Otherwise home life has no meaning. Unless one is religiously guided by intelligence and renders devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his home can never become very pleasing to a saintly person. In other words, if a man has a good mother or a good wife, there is no need of his taking <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span>&mdash;that is, unless it is absolutely necessary, as it was for Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu.</div>

<div class="First">There is no difference between a good wife and good intelligence. One who possesses good intelligence can deliberate properly and save himself from many dangerous conditions. In material existence there is danger at every step. In <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.14.58) it is said: <span class="Italic">pada&#7745; pada&#7745; yad vipad&#257;&#7745; na te&#7779;&#257;m.</span> This material world is not actually a place of residence for an intelligent person or a devotee because here there is danger at every step. Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha is the real home for the devotee, for there is no anxiety and no danger. Good intelligence means becoming K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> it is said: <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a ye bhaje se ba&#7693;a catura.</span> Unless one is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, he cannot be called an intelligent person.</div>

<div class="Purport">Herein we see that King Pura�jana was searching after his good wife, who always helped him out of the dangerous situations that always occur in material existence. As already explained, a real wife is <span class="Italic">dharma-patn&#299;.</span> That is, a woman accepted in marriage by ritualistic ceremony is called <span class="Italic">dharma-patn&#299;,</span> which signifies that she is accepted in terms of religious principles. Children born of <span class="Italic">dharma-patn&#299;,</span> or a woman married according to religious principles, inherit the property of the father, but children born of a woman who is not properly married do not inherit the father&rsquo;s property. The word <span class="Italic">dharma-patn&#299;</span> also refers to a chaste wife. A chaste wife is one who never had any connection with men before her marriage. Once a woman is given the freedom to mingle with all kinds of men in her youth, it is very difficult for her to keep chaste. She generally cannot remain chaste. When butter is brought into the proximity of fire, it melts. The woman is like fire, and man is like the butter. But if one gets a chaste wife, accepted through a religious marriage ritual, she can be of great help when one is threatened by the many dangerous situations of life. Actually such a wife can become the source of all good intelligence. With such a good wife, the family&rsquo;s engagement in the devotional service of the Lord actually makes a home a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama,</span> or household dedicated to spiritual cultivation.</div>

<div class="First">When a person is devoid of devotional service, or <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-bhakti,</span> he takes to many sinful activities. King Pura�jana left home, neglected his own wife and engaged himself in killing animals. This is the position of all materialistic men. They do not care for a married chaste wife. They take the wife only as an instrument for sense enjoyment, not as a means for devotional service. To have unrestricted sex life, the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> work very hard. They have concluded that the best course is to have sex with any woman and simply pay the price for her, as though she were a mercantile commodity. Thus they engage their energy in working very hard for such material acquisitions. Such materialistic people have lost their good intelligence. They must search out their intelligence within the heart. A person who does not have a chaste wife accepted by religious principles always has a bewildered intelligence.</div>
<A NAME="62502"></A><div id="62502"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The wife of King Pura�jana was lying on the ground because she was neglected by her husband. Actually the woman must always be protected by her husband. We always speak of the goddess of fortune as being placed on the chest of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. In other words, the wife must remain embraced by her husband. Thus she becomes beloved and well protected. Just as one saves his money and places it under his own personal protection, one should similarly protect his wife by his own personal supervision. Just as intelligence is always within the heart, so a beloved chaste wife should always have her place on the chest of a good husband. This is the proper relationship between husband and wife. A wife is therefore called <span class="Italic">ardh&#257;&#7749;gan&#299;,</span> or half of the body. One cannot remain with only one leg, one hand or only one side of the body. He must have two sides. Similarly, according to nature&rsquo;s way, husband and wife should live together. In the lower species of life, among birds and animals, it is seen that by nature&rsquo;s arrangement the husband and wife live together. It is similarly ideal in human life for the husband and wife to live together. The home should be a place for devotional service, and the wife should be chaste and accepted by a ritualistic ceremony. In this way one can become happy at home.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">avadhut&#257;m</span> is especially significant, for it refers to a mendicant who does not take care of his body. Since the Queen was lying on the ground without bedding and proper dress, King Pura�jana became very much aggrieved. In other words, he repented that he had neglected his intelligence and had engaged himself in the forest in killing animals. In other words, when one&rsquo;s good intelligence is separated or neglected, he fully engages in sinful activities. Due to neglecting one&rsquo;s good intelligence, or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, one becomes bewildered and engages in sinful activities. Upon realizing this, a man becomes repentant. Such repentance is described by Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura herein says that he repents for having spoiled his human life and knowingly drunk poison. By not being K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, one willingly drinks the poison of material life. The purport is that one certainly becomes addicted to sinful activities when he becomes devoid of his good chaste wife, or when he has lost his good sense and does not take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness.</div>

<div class="First">The King very much regretted having left his Queen and having gone to the forest to execute sinful activities. When a person regrets his sinful activities, the abandoning of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness and good intelligence, his path of deliverance from the path of material clutches is opened.

Naturally one who comes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness regrets his previous sinful activities in the human form. Only by this process can one be delivered from the clutches of nescience or ignorance in materialistic life.</div>

This is the beginning of the surrendering process. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wants everyone to surrender unto Him, and this surrendering process begins when one touches the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. By sincerely rendering service to a bona fide spiritual master, one begins his spiritual life in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Touching the lotus feet of a spiritual master means giving up one&rsquo;s false prestige and unnecessarily puffed-up position in the material world. Those who remain in the darkness of material existence due to their falsely prestigious positions&mdash;so-called scientists and philosophers&mdash;are actually atheists. They do not know the ultimate cause of everything. Although bewildered, they are not ready to surrender themselves to the lotus feet of a person who knows things in their proper perspective. In other words, one cannot arouse K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness simply by his own mental speculation. One must surrender to a bona fide spiritual master. Only this process will help one.</div>

<div class="First">According to Vedic civilization, domestic animals and servants are treated exactly like one&rsquo;s own children. Animals and children are sometimes punished not out of vengeance but out of love. Similarly, a master sometimes punishes his servant, not out of vengeance but out of love, to correct him and bring him to the right point. Thus King Pura�jana took his punishment dealt by his wife, the Queen, as mercy upon him. He considered himself the most obedient servant of the Queen. She was angry at him for his sinful activities&mdash;namely, hunting in the forest and leaving her at home. King Pura�jana accepted the punishment as actual love and affection from his wife. In the same way, when a person is punished by the laws of nature, by the will of God, he should not be disturbed. A real devotee thinks in this way. When a devotee is put into an awkward position, he takes it as the mercy of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This verse states that the devotee accepts a reversal of his position in life as a benediction by the Lord and consequently offers the Lord more obeisances and prayers, thinking that the punishment is due to his past misdeeds and that the Lord is punishing him very mildly. The punishment awarded by the state or by God for one&rsquo;s own faults is actually for one&rsquo;s benefit. In the <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is said that the King should be considered merciful when he condemns a murderer to death because a murderer punished in this life becomes freed from his sinful activity and in the next life takes birth cleared of all sins. If one accepts punishment as a reward dealt by the master, he becomes intelligent enough not to commit the same mistake again.</div>

<div class="First">It is said that when a foolish man is instructed in something very nice, he generally cannot accept it. Indeed, he actually becomes angry. Such anger is compared to the poison of a serpent, for when a serpent is fed milk and bananas, its poison actually increases. Instead of becoming merciful or sober, the serpent increases its poisonous venom when fed nice foodstuffs. Similarly, when a fool is instructed, he does not rectify himself, but actually becomes angry.</div>

<div class="First">An effeminate husband, simply being attracted by the external beauty of his wife, tries to become her most obedient servant. &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has therefore advised that we not become attracted by a lump of flesh and blood. The story is told that at one time a man, very much attracted to a beautiful woman, wooed the woman in such a way that she devised a plan to show him the ingredients of her beauty. The woman made a date to see him, and before seeing him she took a purgative, and that whole day and night she simply passed stool, and she preserved that stool in a pot. The next night, when the man came to see her, she appeared very ugly and emaciated. When the man inquired from her about the woman with whom he had an engagement, she replied, &ldquo;I am that very woman.&rdquo; The man refused to believe her, not knowing that she had lost all her beauty due to the violent purgative that caused her to pass stool day and night. When the man began to argue with her, the woman said that she was not looking beautiful because she was separated from the ingredients of her beauty. When the man asked how she could be so separated, the woman said, &ldquo;Come on, and I will show you.&rdquo; She then showed him the pot filled with liquid stool and vomit. Thus the man became aware that a beautiful woman is simply a lump of matter composed of blood, stool, urine and similar other disgusting ingredients. This is the actual fact, but in a state of illusion, man becomes attracted by illusory beauty and becomes a victim of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span></div>

<div class="First">According to Vedic civilization, a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> or one who is properly qualified to understand the Absolute Truth&mdash;that is, one belonging to the most intelligent social order&mdash;as well as the devotee of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is known as Muradvi&#7779;a, enemy of a demon named Mura, is not subject to the rules and regulations of the state. In other words, upon breaking the laws of the state, everyone can be punished by the government except the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. <span class="Italic">Br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas never transgress the laws of the state or the laws of nature because they know perfectly well the resultant reactions caused by such law-breaking. Even though they may sometimes appear to violate the laws, they are not to be punished by the king. This instruction was given to King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at by N&#257;rada Muni. King Pura�jana was a representative of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at, and N&#257;rada Muni was reminding King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at of his forefather, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, who never chastised a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava.</div>

<div class="Purport">One&rsquo;s pure intelligence, or pure K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, becomes polluted by material activities.

Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a was a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, and consequently Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni was chastised.</div>

<div class="Purport">The conclusion is that if K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is covered by material sins, one can eliminate the sins simply by chanting the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> but if one pollutes his K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness by offending a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, one cannot revive it until one properly atones for the sin by pleasing the offended Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava or <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> This was the course that Durv&#257;s&#257; Muni had to follow, for he surrendered unto Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a. A <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha</span> cannot be atoned for by any means other than by begging the pardon of the offended Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava.</div>
