<div class="Translation">The great sage Maitreya continued speaking to Vidura: My dear Vidura, in this way Lord &#346;iva instructed the sons of King Barhi&#7779;at. The sons of the King also worshiped Lord &#346;iva with great devotion and respect. Finally, Lord &#346;iva became invisible to the princes.</div>

<div class="First">This chapter contains a great lesson concerning the monarchical kingdom in the days of yore. When King Barhi&#7779;at was considering retiring from the royal duties, he sent his sons to perform austerities in order to become perfect kings for the welfare of the citizens. At the same time, King Barhi&#7779;at was being instructed by the great sage N&#257;rada about the material world and the living entity who wants to enjoy it. It is therefore very clear how the kings and princes were trained to take charge of a kingdom. Welfare activities for the benefit of the citizens were aimed at understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The human form of life is especially meant for understanding God, our relationship with Him and our activities in His service. Because the kings took charge of the spiritual education of the citizens, both the king and the citizens were happy in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In this regard, we should remember that the monarchical hierarchy of Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at comes from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva, a great devotee of the Lord and the most celebrated disciple of N&#257;rada Muni. King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at was then too much engaged in fruitive activities due to performing different types of <span class="Italic">yaj�as.</span> One can actually be promoted to higher planetary systems or to the heavenly kingdoms by performing various <span class="Italic">yaj�as,</span> but there is no question of liberation or going back home, back to Godhead. When the great sage N&#257;rada saw that a descendant of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dhruva was being misled by fruitive activities, N&#257;rada took compassion upon him and personally came to instruct him about the ultimate benediction of life, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> How N&#257;rada Muni indirectly introduced the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> system to King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at is very interestingly described in this Twenty-fifth Chapter.</div>

<div class="First">Of course in the modern age one may be amazed how the princes could stand in the water for ten thousand years. However, living within air or living within water is the same process; one simply has to learn how to do it. The aquatics live within water for their whole life-span. Certain favorable conditions are created to enable them to live within water. In those days, however, people used to live for one hundred thousand years. Out of so many years, if one could spare ten thousand years for the sake of austerity, he would be assured of success in his future life. This was not very astonishing. Although such a feat is impossible in this age, it was quite possible in Satya-yuga.</div>

<div class="First">As pointed out by Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> or merging into the Brahman effulgence, is just like going to hell. He similarly states that elevation to the upper planetary systems for the enjoyment of heavenly life is just so much phantasmagoria. This means that a devotee does not give any importance to the ultimate goal of the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s.</span> The ultimate goal of the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> is promotion to the heavenly kingdom, and the ultimate goal of the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> is merging into the Brahman effulgence. Of course, the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> are superior to the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> as confirmed by Lord Caitanya. <span class="Italic">Ko&#7789;i-karmani&#7779;&#7789;ha-madhye eka &lsquo;j�&#257;n&#299;&rsquo; &#347;re&#7779;&#7789;ha:</span> &ldquo;one <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;,</span> or impersonalist, is better than many thousands of fruitive actors.&rdquo; (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/madhya/19/147?d=1">19.147</a>) Therefore a devotee never enters upon the path of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> or elevation by fruitive activities. N&#257;rada Muni took compassion upon King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at when he saw the King engaged in fruitive activity. In comparison to mundane workers, those who are trying to be elevated to the higher planetary systems by performing <span class="Italic">yaj�as</span> are undoubtedly superior. In pure devotional service, however, both <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na</span> are considered bewildering features of the illusory energy.</div>

<div class="Translation">N&#257;rada Muni asked King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at: My dear King, what do you desire to achieve by performing these fruitive activities? The chief aim of life is to get rid of all miseries and enjoy happiness, but these two things cannot be realized by fruitive activity.</div>
<A NAME="61432"></A><div id="61432"> </div>
<div class="Verse-Section">PURPORT</div>
<A NAME="61433"></A><div id="61433"> </div>
<div class="First">In this material world there is a great illusion which covers real intelligence. A man in the mode of passion wants to work very hard to derive some benefit, but he does not know that time will never allow him to enjoy anything permanently. Compared with the work one expends, the gain is not so profitable. Even if it is profitable, it is not without its distresses. If a man is not born rich and he wants to purchase a house, cars and other material things, he has to work hard day and night for many years in order to possess them. Thus happiness is not attained without undergoing some distress.</div>
<A NAME="61434"></A><div id="61434"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Actually, pure happiness cannot be had within this material world. If we wish to enjoy something, we must suffer for something else. On the whole, suffering is the nature of this material world, and whatever enjoyment we are trying to achieve is simply illusion. After all, we have to suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. We may discover many fine medicines, but it is not possible to stop the sufferings of disease or death. Actually, medicine is not the counteracting agent for either disease or death. On the whole there is no happiness in this material world, but an illusioned person works very hard for so-called happiness. Indeed, this process of working hard is actually taken for happiness. This is called illusion.</div>
<A NAME="61435"></A><div id="61435"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore N&#257;rada Muni asked King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at what he desired to attain by performing so many costly sacrifices. Even if one attains a heavenly planet, he cannot avoid the distresses of birth, old age, disease and death. Someone may argue that even devotees have to undergo many distresses in executing austerities and penances connected with devotional service. Of course, for the neophytes the routine of devotional service may be very painful, but at least they have the hope that they will ultimately be able to avoid all kinds of distresses and achieve the highest perfectional stage of happiness. For the common <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> there is no such hope because even if they are promoted to the higher planetary systems, they are not guaranteed freedom from the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. Even Lord Brahm&#257;, who is situated in the highest planetary system (Brahmaloka), has to die. Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s birth and death may be different from an ordinary man&rsquo;s, but within this material world he cannot avoid the distresses of birth, old age, disease and death. If one is at all serious about attaining liberation from these miseries, he must take to devotional service. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/9?d=1">4.9</a>):</div>

<div class="Purport">Thus after attaining full K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, the devotee does not return to this material world after death. He goes back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfect stage of happiness, unblemished by any trace of distress.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">As long as a person is entangled in fruitive activities, he is bound to accept one body after another. This is called <span class="Italic">karma-bandha-ph&#257;&#7749;sa</span>&mdash;entanglement in fruitive activities. It does not matter whether one is engaged in pious or impious activities, for both are causes for further entanglement in material bodies. By pious activities one can take birth in a rich family and get a good education and a beautiful body, but this does not mean that the distresses of life are ultimately eliminated. In the Western countries it is not unusual for one to take birth in a rich aristocratic family, nor is it unusual for one to have a good education and a very beautiful body, but this does not mean that Westerners are free from the distresses of life. Although at the present moment the younger generation in Western countries has sufficient education, beauty and wealth, and although there is enough food, clothing, and facilities for sense gratification, they are in distress. Indeed, they are so distressed that they become hippies, and the laws of nature force them to accept a wretched life. Thus they go about unclean and without shelter or food, and they are forced to sleep in the street. It can be concluded that one cannot become happy by simply performing pious activities. It is not a fact that those who are born with a silver spoon in their mouth are free from the material miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. The conclusion is that one cannot be happy by simply executing pious or impious activities. Such activities simply cause entanglement and transmigration from one body to another. Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura calls this <span class="Italic">karma-bandha-ph&#257;&#7749;sa.</span></div>

<div class="First">Because animal sacrifice is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> there are animal sacrifices in almost all religious rituals. However, one should not be satisfied simply by killing animals according to the directions of the scriptures. One should transcend the ritualistic ceremonies and try to understand the actual truth, the purpose of life. N&#257;rada Muni wanted to instruct the King about the real purpose of life and invoke a spirit of renunciation in his heart. Knowledge and the spirit of renunciation (<span class="Italic">j�&#257;na-vair&#257;gya</span>) are the ultimate goal of life. Without knowledge, one cannot become detached from material enjoyment, and without being detached from material enjoyment, one cannot make spiritual advancement. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s</span> are generally engaged in sense gratification, and for this end they are prepared to commit so many sinful activities. Animal sacrifice is but one such sinful activity. Consequently, by his mystic power N&#257;rada Muni showed King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at the dead animals which he had sacrificed.</div>

<div class="First">N&#257;rada Muni wanted to draw King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at&rsquo;s attention to the excesses of killing animals in sacrifices. It is said in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> that by killing animals in a sacrifice, one immediately promotes them to human birth. Similarly, by killing their enemies on a battlefield, the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> who fight for a right cause are elevated to the heavenly planets after death. In <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> it is stated that it is necessary for a king to execute a murderer so that the murderer will not suffer for his criminal actions in his next life. On the basis of such understanding, N&#257;rada Muni warns the King that the animals killed in sacrifices by the King await him at his death in order to avenge themselves. N&#257;rada Muni is not contradicting himself here. N&#257;rada Muni wanted to convince the King that overindulgence in animal sacrifice is risky because as soon as there is a small discrepancy in the execution of such a sacrifice, the slaughtered animal may not be promoted to a human form of life. Consequently, the person performing sacrifice will be responsible for the death of the animal, just as much as a murderer is responsible for killing another man. When animals are killed in a slaughterhouse, six people connected with the killing are responsible for the murder. The person who gives permission for the killing, the person who kills, the person who helps, the person who purchases the meat, the person who cooks the flesh and the person who eats it, all become entangled in the killing. N&#257;rada Muni wanted to draw the King&rsquo;s attention to this fact. Thus animal-killing is not encouraged even in a sacrifice.</div>

<div class="First">The great sage N&#257;rada Muni turned toward another topic&mdash;the history of King Pura�jana. This is nothing but the history of King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at told in a different way. In other words, this is an allegorical presentation. The word <span class="Italic">pura�jana</span> means &ldquo;one who enjoys in a body.&rdquo; This is clearly explained in the next few chapters. Because a person entangled in material activities wants to hear stories of material activities, N&#257;rada Muni turned to the topics of King Pura�jana, who is none other than King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at. N&#257;rada Muni did not directly deprecate the value of performing sacrifices in which animals are sacrificed. Lord Buddha, however, directly rejected all animal sacrifice. &#346;r&#299;la Jayadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; has stated: <span class="Italic">nindasi yaj�a-vidher ahaha &#347;ruti-j&#257;tam.</span> The word <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti j&#257;tam</span> indicates that in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> animal sacrifice is recommended, but Lord Buddha directly denied Vedic authority in order to stop animal sacrifice. Consequently Lord Buddha is not accepted by the followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Because he does not accept the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> Lord Buddha is depicted as an agnostic or atheist. The great sage N&#257;rada cannot decry the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but he wanted to indicate to King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at that the path of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> is very difficult and risky.</div>
<A NAME="61513"></A><div id="61513"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Foolish persons accept the difficult path of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> for the sake of sense enjoyment, and those who are too much attached to sense enjoyment are called <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has</span> (rascals). It is very difficult for a <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;ha</span> to understand the ultimate goal of life. In the propagation of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, we actually see that many people are not attracted because they are <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has</span> engaged in fruitive activity. It is said: <span class="Italic">upade&#347;o hi m&#363;rkh&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; prakop&#257;ya na &#347;&#257;ntaye.</span> If good instructions are given to a foolish rascal, he simply becomes angry and turns against the instructions instead of taking advantage of them. Because N&#257;rada Muni knew this very well, he indirectly instructed the King by giving him the history of his entire life. In order to wear a gold or diamond nose pin or earring, one has to pierce the ear or nose. Such pain endured for the sake of sense gratification is endured on the path of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> the path of fruitive activity. If one wishes to enjoy something in the future, he has to endure trouble in the present. If one wants to become a millionaire in the future and enjoy his riches, he has to work very hard at the present moment in order to accumulate money. This is <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya.</span> Those who are too much attached to such a path undergo the risk anyway. N&#257;rada Muni wanted to show King Pr&#257;c&#299;nabarhi&#7779;at how one undergoes great troubles and miseries in order to engage in fruitive activity. A person who is very much attached to material activity is called <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;ay&#299;.</span> A <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;ay&#299;</span> is an enjoyer of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;aya,</span> which means eating, sleeping, mating and defending. N&#257;rada Muni is indirectly indicating through the story of King Pura�jana that eating, sleeping, mating and defending are troublesome and risky.</div>
<A NAME="61514"></A><div id="61514"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">itih&#257;sam</span> (&ldquo;history&rdquo;) and <span class="Italic">pur&#257;tanam</span> (&ldquo;old&rdquo;) indicate that although a living entity lives within the material body, the history of the living entity within the material body is very old. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura has sung, <span class="Italic">an&#257;di karama-phale, padi&rsquo; bhav&#257;r&#7751;ava jale, tarib&#257;re n&#257; dekhi up&#257;ya:</span> &ldquo;Due to my past fruitive activities I have fallen into the water of material existence, and I cannot find any way to get out of it.&rdquo; Every living entity is suffering in this material existence from past activities; therefore everyone has a very old history. Foolish material scientists have manufactured their own theories of evolution, which are simply concerned with the material body. But actually this is not the real evolution. The real evolution is the history of the living entity, who is <span class="Italic">pura�jana,</span> &ldquo;living within the body.&rdquo; &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni will explain this evolutionary theory in a different way for the understanding of sane persons.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear King, once in the past lived a king named Pura�jana, who was celebrated for his great activities. He had a friend named Avij�&#257;ta [&ldquo;the unknown one&rdquo;]. No one could understand the activities of Avij�&#257;ta.</div>

<div class="First">Every living entity is <span class="Italic">pura�jana.</span> The word <span class="Italic">puram</span> means &ldquo;within this body, within this form,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">jana</span> means &ldquo;living entity.&rdquo; Thus everyone is <span class="Italic">pura�jana.</span> Every living entity is supposed to be the king of his body because the living entity is given full freedom to use his body as he likes. He usually engages his body for sense gratification, because one who is in the bodily conception of life feels that the ultimate goal of life is to serve the senses. This is the process of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a.</span> One who has no inner knowledge, who does not know that he is actually the spirit soul living within the body, who is simply enamored by the dictation of the senses, is called a materialist. A materialistic person interested in sense gratification can be called a <span class="Italic">pura�jana.</span> Because such a materialistic person utilizes his senses according to his whims, he may also be called a king. An irresponsible king takes the royal position to be his personal property and misuses his treasury for sense gratification.</div>

<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">b&#7771;hac-chrav&#257;&#7717;</span> is also significant. The word <span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7717;</span> means &ldquo;fame.&rdquo; The living entity is famous from ancient times, for as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/20?d=1">2.20</a>), <span class="Italic">na j&#257;yate mriyate v&#257;:</span> &ldquo;The living entity is never born and never dies.&rdquo; Because he is eternal, his activities are eternal, although they are performed in different types of bodies. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re:</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/20?d=1">2.20</a></I>]</I> &ldquo;He does not die, even after the annihilation of the body.&rdquo; Thus the living entity transmigrates from one body to another and performs various activities. In each body the living entity performs so many acts. Sometimes he becomes a great hero&mdash;just like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and Ka&#7745;sa or, in the modern age, Napoleon or Hitler. The activities of such men are certainly very great, but as soon as their bodies are finished, everything else is finished. Then they remain in name only. Therefore a living entity may be called <span class="Italic">b&#7771;hac-chrav&#257;&#7717;;</span> he may have a great reputation for various types of activities. Nonetheless, he has a friend whom he does not know. Materialistic persons do not understand that God is present as the Supersoul, who is situated within the heart of every living entity. Although the Param&#257;tm&#257; sits beside the <span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;</span> as a friend, the <span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;,</span> or living entity, does not know it. Consequently he is described as <span class="Italic">avij�&#257;ta-sakh&#257;,</span> meaning &ldquo;one who has an unknown friend.&rdquo; The word <span class="Italic">avij�&#257;ta-ce&#7779;&#7789;ita&#7717;</span> is also significant because a living entity works hard under the direction of the Param&#257;tm&#257; and is carried away by the laws of nature. Nonetheless, he thinks himself independent of God and independent of the stringent laws of material nature. It is stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/24?d=1">2.24</a>):</div>

<div class="First">The travelings of Pura�jana are similar to the travelings of the modern hippies. Generally hippies are sons of great fathers and great families. It is not that they are always poor. But some way or another they abandon the shelter of their rich fathers and travel all over the world. As stated in this verse, the living entity wants to become a <span class="Italic">prabhu,</span> or master. The word <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> means &ldquo;master,&rdquo; but actually the living entity is not a master; he is the eternal servant of God. When the living entity abandons the shelter of God, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and tries to become a <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> independently, he travels all over the creation. There are 8,400,000 species of life and millions and millions and trillions of planets within the creation. The living entity wanders throughout these various types of bodies and throughout different planets, and thus he is like King Pura�jana, who traveled all over the world looking for a suitable place to live.</div>

Thus Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura points out that the living entity travels in different types of bodies and eats all kinds of abominable things.

<div class="After-Verse">Material sense gratification, with society, friendship and love, is herein compared to a drop of water falling on a desert. A desert requires oceans of water to satisfy it, and if only a drop of water is supplied, what is its use? Similarly, the living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, as stated in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> is <span class="Italic">&#257;nandamayo &rsquo;bhy&#257;s&#257;t,</span> full of enjoyment. Being part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity is also seeking complete enjoyment. However, complete enjoyment cannot be achieved separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In his wanderings in the different species of life, the living entity may taste some type of enjoyment in one body or another, but full enjoyment of the senses cannot be obtained in any material body. Thus Pura�jana, the living entity, wanders in different types of bodies, but everywhere meets frustration in his attempt to enjoy. In other words, the spiritual spark covered by matter cannot fully enjoy the senses in any circumstance in material life. A deer may become absorbed in the musical sounds vibrated by the hunter, but the result is that it loses its life. Similarly, a fish is very expert in gratifying its tongue, but when it eats the bait offered by the fisherman, it loses its life. Even the elephant, who is so strong, is captured and loses its independence while satisfying its genitals with a female elephant. In each and every species of life, the living entity gets a body to satisfy various senses, but he cannot enjoy all his senses at one time. In the human form of life he gets an opportunity to enjoy all his senses pervertedly, but the result is that he becomes so harassed in his attempted sense gratification that he ultimately becomes morose. As he tries to satisfy his senses more and more, he becomes more and more entangled.</div>

<div class="Translation">Once, while wandering in this way, he saw on the southern side of the Himalayas, in a place named Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a [India], a city that had nine gates all about and was characterized by all auspicious facilities.</div>

<div class="First">The tract of land south of the Himalaya Mountains is the land of India, which was known as Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a. When a living entity takes birth in Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a he is considered to be most fortunate. Indeed, Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has stated:</div>
<A NAME="61590"></A><div id="61590"> </div>
<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">bh&#257;rata-bh&#363;mite haila manu&#7779;ya-janma y&#257;ra<br>janma s&#257;rthaka kari&rsquo; kara para-upak&#257;ra</div>

<A NAME="61592"></A><div id="61592"> </div>
<div class="After-Verse">Thus whoever takes birth in the land of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a attains all the facilities of life. He may take advantage of all these facilities for both material and spiritual advancement and thus make his life successful. After attaining the goal of life, one may distribute his knowledge and experience all over the world for humanitarian purposes. In other words, one who takes birth in the land of Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a by virtue of his past pious activities gets full facility to develop the human form of life. In India, the climatic condition is such that one can live very peacefully without being disturbed by material conditions. Indeed, during the time of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira or Lord R&#257;macandra, people were free from all anxieties. There was not even extreme cold or extreme heat. The three kinds of miserable conditions&mdash;<span class="Italic">adhy&#257;tmika, adhibhautika</span> and <span class="Italic">adhidaivika</span> (miseries inflicted by the body and mind itself, those inflicted by other living entities, and natural disturbances)&mdash;were all absent during the reign of Lord R&#257;macandra or Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira. But at present, compared to other countries on earth, India is artificially disturbed. Despite these material disturbances, however, the country&rsquo;s culture is such that one can easily attain the goal of life&mdash;namely salvation, or liberation from material bondage. Thus in order to take birth in India one must have performed many pious activities in a past life.</div>
<A NAME="61593"></A><div id="61593"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">lak&#7779;ita-lak&#7779;a&#7751;&#257;m</span> indicates that the human body attained in Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a is very auspicious. Vedic culture is full of knowledge, and a person born in India can fully take advantage of Vedic cultural knowledge and the cultural system known as <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma.</span> Even at the present time, as we travel all over the world, we see that in some countries human beings have many material facilities but no facilities for spiritual advancement. We find everywhere the defects of one-sided facilities and a lack of full facilities. A blind man can walk but not see, and a lame man cannot walk but can see. <span class="Italic">Andha-pa&#7749;gu-ny&#257;ya.</span> The blind man may take the lame man over his shoulder, and as he walks the lame man may give him directions. Thus combined they may work, but individually neither the blind man nor the lame man can walk successfully. Similarly, this human form of life is meant for the advancement of spiritual life and for keeping the material necessities in order. Especially in the Western countries there are ample facilities for material comforts, but no one has any idea of spiritual advancement. Many are hankering after spiritual advancement, but many cheaters come, take advantage of their money, bluff them and go away. Fortunately the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is there to give all facilities for both material and spiritual advancement. In this way people in the Western countries may take advantage of this movement. In India any man in the villages, unaffected by the industrial cities of India, can still live in any condition and make spiritual advancement. The body has been called the city of nine gates, and these nine gates include two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, a genital and a rectum. When the nine gates are clean and working properly, it is to be understood that the body is healthy. In India these nine gates are kept clean by the villagers who rise early in the morning, bathe in the well or rivers, go to the temples to attend <span class="Italic">ma&#7749;gala-&#257;rati,</span> chant the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> and take <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da.</span> In this way one can take advantage of all the facilities of human life. We are gradually introducing this system in different centers in our Society in the Western countries. One who takes advantage of it becomes more and more enlightened in spiritual life. At the present moment, India may be compared to the lame man and the Western countries to the blind man. For the past two thousand years India has been subjugated by the rule of foreigners, and the legs of progress have been broken. In the Western countries the eyes of the people have become blind due to the dazzling glitter of material opulence. The blind man of the Western countries and the lame man of India should combine together in this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. Then the lame man of India can walk with the help of the Westerner, and the blind Westerner can see with the help of the lame man. In short, the material advancement of the Western countries and the spiritual assets of India should combine for the elevation of all human society.</div>

<div class="First">Since the body is a great city, there must be various arrangements such as lakes and gardens for sense enjoyment. Of the various parts of the body, those which incite sexual impulses are referred to here indirectly. Because the body has genitals, when the living entity attains the right age&mdash;be he man or woman&mdash;he becomes agitated by the sex impulse. As long as one remains a child, he is not agitated by seeing a beautiful woman. Although the sense organs are present, unless the age is ripe there is no sex impulse. The favorable conditions surrounding the sex impulse are compared here to a garden or a nice solitary park. When one sees the opposite sex, naturally the sex impulse increases. It is said that if a man in a solitary place does not become agitated upon seeing a woman, he is to be considered a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> But this practice is almost impossible. The sex impulse is so strong that even by seeing, touching or talking, coming into contact with, or even thinking of the opposite sex&mdash;even in so many subtle ways&mdash;one becomes sexually impelled. Consequently, a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> or <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is prohibited to associate with women, especially in a secret place. The <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> enjoin that one should not even talk to a woman in a secret place, even if she happens to be one&rsquo;s own daughter, sister or mother. The sex impulse is so strong that even if one is very learned, he becomes agitated in such circumstances. If this is the case, how can a young man in a nice park remain calm and quiet after seeing a beautiful young woman?</div>

<div class="Purport">These representatives of attachment and envy are very much unfavorable for advancement in spiritual life. One should not be attracted by the breasts of young women. The great saint &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya has described the breasts of women, especially young women, as nothing but a combination of muscles and blood, so one should not be attracted by the illusory energy of raised breasts with nipples.

Because the breasts are equally attractive, they are described as <span class="Italic">sama-v&#7771;ttau.</span> The sex impulse remains in an old man&rsquo;s heart also, even up to the point of death.

The word <span class="Italic">nirantarau</span> is significant because although the breasts are situated in different locations, the action is the same. We should not make any distinction between attachment and envy. As described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/37?d=1">3.37</a>), they are both products of <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> (<span class="Italic">k&#257;ma e&#7779;a krodha e&#7779;a rajo-gu&#7751;a-samudbhava&#7717;</span>).</div>

<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">nig&#363;hant&#299;m</span> (&ldquo;trying to cover&rdquo;) indicates that even if one is tainted by <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma, lobha, krodha,</span> etc., they can be transfigured by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In other words, one can utilize <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> (lust) for serving K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Being impelled by lust, an ordinary worker will work hard day and night; similarly a devotee can work hard day and night to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Just as <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are working hard to satisfy <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma-krodha,</span> a devotee should work in the same way to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Similarly, <span class="Italic">krodha</span> (anger) can also be used in the service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a when it is applied to the nondevotee demons. Hanum&#257;nj&#299; applied his anger in this way. He was a great devotee of Lord R&#257;macandra, and he utilized his anger to set fire to the kingdom of R&#257;va&#7751;a, a nondevotee demon. Thus <span class="Italic">k&#257;ma</span> (lust) can be utilized to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and <span class="Italic">krodha</span> (anger) can be utilized to punish the demons. When both are used for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service, they lose their material significance and become spiritually important.</div>

<div class="Translation">Pura�jana, the hero, became attracted by the eyebrows and smiling face of the very beautiful girl and was immediately pierced by the arrows of her lusty desires. When she smiled shyly, she looked very beautiful to Pura�jana, who, although a hero, could not refrain from addressing her.</div>

<div class="First">Every living entity is a hero in two ways. When he is a victim of the illusory energy, he works as a great hero in the material world, as a great leader, politician, businessman, industrialist, etc., and his heroic activities contribute to the material advancement of civilization. One can also become a hero by being master of the senses, a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;.</span> Material activities are false heroic activities, whereas restraining the senses from material engagement is great heroism. However great a hero one may be in the material world, he can be immediately conquered by the lumps of flesh and blood known as the breasts of women. In the history of material activities there are many examples, like the Roman hero Antony, who became captivated by the beauty of Cleopatra. Similarly, a great hero in India named Baji Rao became a victim of a woman during the time of Maharashtrian politics, and he was defeated. From history we understand that formerly politicians used to employ beautiful girls who were trained as <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;a-kany&#257;.</span> These girls had poison injected into their bodies from the beginning of their lives so that in due course of time they would become so immune to the poison and so poisonous themselves that simply by kissing a person they could kill him. These poisonous girls were engaged to see an enemy and kill him with a kiss. Thus there are many instances in human history of heroes who have been curbed simply by women. Being part and parcel of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the living entity is certainly a great hero, but due to his own weakness he becomes attracted to the material features.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">It is said in the <I>P<span class="Italic"></I>rema-vivarta</span> that when a living entity wants to enjoy material nature, he is immediately victimized by the material energy. A living entity is not forced to come into the material world. He makes his own choice, being attracted by beautiful women. Every living entity has the freedom to be attracted by material nature or to stand as a hero and resist that attraction. It is simply a question of the living entity&rsquo;s being attracted or not being attracted. There is no question of his being forced to come into contact with material energy. One who can keep himself steady and resist the attraction of material nature is certainly a hero and deserves to be called a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;.</span> Unless one is master of the senses, he cannot become a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;.</span> The living entity can take one of two positions in this world. He may become a servant of his senses, or he may become master of them. By becoming a servant of the senses, one becomes a great material hero, and by becoming master of the senses, he becomes a <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;,</span> or spiritual hero.</div>

<div class="First">The first aphorism in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> is <span class="Italic"><BC:255,255,0>ath&#257;to brahma jij�&#257;s&#257;<BC>.</span> In the human form of life one should put many questions to himself and to his intelligence. In the various forms of life lower than human life the intelligence does not go beyond the range of life&rsquo;s primary necessities&mdash;namely eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Dogs, cats and tigers are always busy trying to find something to eat or a place to sleep, trying to defend and have sexual intercourse successfully. In the human form of life, however, one should be intelligent enough to ask what he is, why he has come into the world, what his duty is, who is the supreme controller, what is the difference between dull matter and the living entity, etc. There are so many questions, and the person who is actually intelligent should simply inquire about the supreme source of everything: <span class="Italic"><BC:255,255,0>ath&#257;to brahma jij�&#257;s&#257;<BC>.</span> A living entity is always connected with a certain amount of intelligence, but in the human form of life the living entity must inquire about his spiritual identity. This is real human intelligence. It is said that one who is simply conscious of the body is no better than an animal, even though he be in the human form. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>) &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">sarvasya c&#257;ha&#7745; h&#7771;di sannivi&#7779;&#7789;o matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j�&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca:</span> &ldquo;I am seated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.&rdquo; In the animal form the living entity is completely forgetful of his relationship with God. This is called <span class="Italic">apohanam,</span> or forgetfulness. In the human form of life, however, consciousness is more greatly developed, and consequently the human being has a chance to understand his relationship with God. In the human form one should utilize his intelligence by asking all these questions, just as Pura�jana, the living entity, is asking the unknown girl where she has come from, what her business is, why she is present, etc. These are inquiries about <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-tattva</span>&mdash;self-realization. The conclusion is that unless a living entity is inquisitive about self-realization he is nothing but an animal.</div>

<div class="First">The ten strong servants of the mind are the five working senses and the five knowledge-gathering senses. All these ten senses work under the aegis of the mind.

The hundreds of women under the jurisdiction of the senses are addressed here as <span class="Italic">lalan&#257;&#7717;.</span> The mind works under the intelligence, and under the mind are the ten senses, and under the ten senses are innumerable desires to be fulfilled.

All this paraphernalia simply constitutes different sources of anxiety, but one who is surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who leaves all business to Him, is freed from such anxieties. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja advises a person who has taken to the materialistic way of life, which is never permanent but always temporary, to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and leave aside all his so-called responsibilities in order to get free from all anxieties.</div>

<div class="First">Everyone thinks that his intelligence is perfect. Sometimes one employs his intelligence in the worship of Um&#257;, the wife of Lord &#346;iva, in order to obtain a beautiful wife. Sometimes, when one wants to become as learned as Lord Brahm&#257;, he employs his intelligence in the worship of the goddess of learning, Sarasvat&#299;. Sometimes, when one wishes to become as opulent as Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, he worships the goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;. In this verse all these inquiries are made by King Pura�jana, the living entity who is bewildered and does not know how to employ his intelligence. Intelligence should be employed in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As soon as one uses his intelligence in this way, the goddess of fortune automatically becomes favorable to him. The goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;, never remains without her husband, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Consequently, when one worships Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u he automatically obtains the favor of the goddess of fortune. One should not, like R&#257;va&#7751;a, worship the goddess of fortune alone, for she cannot remain long without her husband. Thus her other name is Ca�cal&#257;, or restless. In this verse it is clear that Pura�jana is representing our intelligence while he is talking with the girl. He not only appreciated the shyness of the girl but actually became more and more attracted by that shyness. He was actually thinking of becoming her husband and consequently was asking her whether she was thinking of her prospective husband or whether she was married. This is an example of <span class="Italic">bhoga-icch&#257;</span>&mdash;the desire for enjoyment. One who is attracted by such desires becomes conditioned in this material world, and one who is not so attracted attains liberation. King Pura�jana was appreciating the beauty of the girl as if she were the goddess of fortune, but at the same time he was careful to understand that the goddess of fortune cannot be enjoyed by anyone except Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Since he doubted whether the girl was the goddess of fortune, he inquired about the lotus flower she was not holding. The material world is also the goddess of fortune because the material energy works under the direction of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, as stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">may&#257;dhyak&#7779;e&#7751;a prak&#7771;ti&#7717; s&#363;yate sa-car&#257;caram</span>).</div>

Because R&#257;va&#7751;a wanted to enjoy the goddess of fortune, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;, he was vanquished with all his family, wealth and opulence. One can, however, enjoy that <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> bestowed upon the living entity by Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. The satisfaction of one&rsquo;s senses and desires means enjoying <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> not the goddess of fortune.</div>

<div class="First">There is a difference between demoniac mentality and devotional mentality. Devotees know perfectly well that the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, cannot be enjoyed by a living entity. This higher sense of understanding is called K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Nonetheless, everyone wants to become happy by imitating the prosperity of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. In this verse Pura�jana states that the girl appears to be an ordinary woman. However, since he is attracted by her, he requests that she become as happy as the goddess of fortune by associating with him. Thus he introduces himself as a great king with great influence so that she might accept him as her husband and be as happy as the goddess of fortune. To desire to enjoy this material world as a subordinate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is godly. The demons, however, want to enjoy this material world without considering the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the difference between a demon and a demigod.</div>
<A NAME="61812"></A><div id="61812"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">bhuvi-sp&#7771;k</span> mentioned in this verse is very significant. When the demigods sometimes come to this planet, they do not touch the ground. Pura�jana could understand that this girl did not belong to the transcendental world or the higher planetary system because her feet were touching the ground. Since every woman in this world wants her husband to be very influential, rich and powerful, Pura�jana, to seduce the girl, introduced himself as such a personality. In the material world, whether one be a man or a woman, one wants to enjoy. A man wants to enjoy a beautiful woman, and a woman wants to enjoy a powerful, opulent man. Every living entity who possesses such material desires is called <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> an enjoyer. Superficially it appears that the woman is the enjoyed and the man is the enjoyer, but internally everyone is an enjoyer. Consequently everything in this material world is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span></div>

When one is agitated by lusty desires, his senses are attracted by all kinds of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;aya</span> (enjoyable things like sound, touch, form, smell and taste). These attractive sense objects oblige one to come under the control of a woman. In this way the conditional life of a living entity begins.

<div class="First">Such a speech is typical of a living entity attracted by the opposite sex. This is called bewilderment occasioned by becoming conditioned by material nature. When thus attracted by the beauty of the material energy, one becomes very eager to enjoy. This is elaborately described in this instance of Pura�jana&rsquo;s becoming attracted by the beautiful woman. In conditional life the living entity is attracted by a face, eyebrows or eyes, a voice or anything. In short, everything becomes attractive. When a man or a woman is attracted by the opposite sex, it does not matter whether the opposite sex is beautiful or not. The lover sees everything beautiful in the face of the beloved and thus becomes attracted. This attraction causes the living entity to fall down in this material world. This is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/27?d=1">7.27</a>):</div>

<div class="First">The living entity is ignorant of his origin. He does not know why this material world was created, why others are working in this material world and what the ultimate source of this manifestation is. No one knows the answers to these questions, and this is called ignorance. By researching into the origin of life, important scientists are finding some chemical compositions or cellular combinations, but actually no one knows the original source of life within this material world. The phrase <span class="Italic">brahma jij�&#257;s&#257;</span> is used to indicate an inquisitiveness to know the original source of our existence in this material world. No philosopher, scientist or politician actually knows wherefrom we have come, why we are here struggling so hard for existence and where we will go. Generally people are of the opinion that we are all here accidentally and that as soon as these bodies are finished all our dramatic activities will be finished and we will become zero. Such scientists and philosophers are impersonalists and voidists. In this verse the girl is expressing the actual position of the living entity. She cannot tell Pura�jana her father&rsquo;s name because she does not know from where she has come. Nor does she know why she is present in that place. She frankly says that she does not know anything about all this. This is the position of the living entity in the material world. There are so many scientists, philosophers and big leaders, but they do not know wherefrom they have come, nor do they know why they are busy within this material world to obtain a position of so-called happiness. In this material world we have many nice facilities for living, but we are so foolish that we do not ask who has made this world habitable for us and has arranged it so nicely. Everything is functioning in order, but people foolishly think that they are produced by chance in this material world and that after death they will become zero. They think that this beautiful place of habitation will automatically remain.</div>

<div class="First">Pura�jana inquired from the woman about those eleven men and their wives and the snake. The woman gave a brief description of them. She was obviously without full knowledge of her surrounding men and women and the snake. As stated before, the snake is the vital force of the living being. This vital force always remains awake even when the body and the senses become fatigued and do no work. Even in the state of unconsciousness, when we sleep, the snake, or the life-force, remains intact and awake. Consequently we dream when we sleep. When the living entity gives up this material body, the vital force still remains intact and is carried to another material body. That is called transmigration, or change of the body, and we have come to know this process as death. Actually, there is no death. The vital force always exists with the soul, and when the soul is awakened from so-called sleep, he can see his eleven friends, or the active senses and the mind with their various desires (wives). The vital life-force remains. Even during our sleeping hours we can understand by virtue of our breathing process that the snake lives by eating the air that passes within this body. Air is exhibited in the form of breathing, and as long as breath is there, one can understand that a sleeping man is alive. Even when the gross body is asleep the vital force remains active and alive to protect the body. Thus the snake is described as living and eating air to keep the body fit for life.</div>

<div class="Purport">When a devotee is advancing toward spiritual realization, his only aim is the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He does not care for any other material or spiritual activity. King Pura�jana represents the ordinary living entity, and the woman represents the ordinary living entity&rsquo;s intelligence. Combined, the living entity enjoys his material senses, and the intelligence supplies all paraphernalia for his enjoyment. As soon as he enters the human form, the living entity is entrapped by a family tradition, nationality, customs, etc. These are all supplied by the <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus the living entity, under the bodily conception of life, utilizes his intelligence to his best capacity in order to satisfy his senses.</div>

For example, everyone has the propensity for sex life, but in demoniac civilization sex is enjoyed without restriction. According to Vedic culture, sex is enjoyed under Vedic instructions. Thus the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> give direction to civilized human beings to enable them to satisfy their propensities for sense gratification.</div>

In this life such a person gets all kinds of material opulences, such as sons and grandsons, because he is always engaged in various religious functions. The material distresses are birth, old age, disease and death, but those who are interested in <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga</span> hold various religious functions at the time of birth, old age, disease and death.

The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;,</span> however, who is interested only in sense gratification, does not follow any Vedic instruction. The <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;</span> engages himself as an advocate of sex life and also allows his sons and daughters to engage in sex and to be deprived of any glorious end in life. A <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> enjoys sex life in this life as well as in the next, but a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hamedh&#299;</span> does not know what the next life is about because he is simply interested in sex in this life. On the whole, when one is too much inclined toward sex, he does not care for the transcendental spiritual life. In this age of Kali especially, no one is interested in spiritual advancement. Even though it is sometimes found that one may be interested in spiritual advancement, he is most likely to accept a bogus method of spiritual life, being misguided by so many pretenders.</div>

We receive heat, light, water and all other natural amenities through the mercy of the demigods. We are also indebted to our forefathers, who have given us these bodies, paternal property, intelligence, society, friendship and love. Similarly, we are indebted to the general public for politics and sociology, and we are also indebted to lower animals such as horses, cows, asses, dogs and cats.

<div class="First">Every husband is certainly a great hero to his wife. In other words, if a woman loves a man, that man appears very beautiful and magnanimous. Unless one becomes beautiful in the eyes of another, one cannot dedicate his whole life to another. The husband is considered very magnanimous because he gives as many children to the wife as she likes. Every woman is fond of children; therefore any husband who can please his wife by sex and give her children is considered very magnanimous. Not only does the husband become magnanimous by begetting children, but by giving his wife ornaments, nice food and dresses, he keeps her completely under submission. Such a satisfied wife will never give up the company of her husband. <span class="Italic">Manu-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> recommends that to keep a wife satisfied a husband should give her some ornaments because women are generally fond of home, ornaments, dresses, children, etc. In this way the woman is the center of all material enjoyment.</div>

<div class="Purport">In this regard, the word <span class="Italic">vikhy&#257;tam</span> is very significant. A man is always famous for his aggression toward a beautiful woman, and such aggression is sometimes considered rape. Although rape is not legally allowed, it is a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at rape.</div>

It is therefore the duty of the father to get his daughter married before she attains puberty. Otherwise she will be very much mortified by not having a husband. Anyone who satisfies her desire for sex at that age becomes a great object of satisfaction. It is a psychological fact that when a woman at the age of puberty meets a man and the man satisfies her sexually, she will love that man for the rest of her life, regardless who he is. Thus so-called love within this material world is nothing but sexual satisfaction.</div>

<div class="First">One hundred years is significant in this connection because every human being is given the concession to live up to a hundred years. The span of life is different on different planets, according to the planet&rsquo;s distance from the sun. In other words, one hundred years on this planet is different from one hundred years on another planet. Lord Brahm&#257; lives for one hundred years according to time on the Brahmaloka planet, but one day of Brahm&#257; is equal to millions of years on this planet. Similarly, the days on the heavenly planets are equal to six months on this planet. On every planet, however, the span of life for a human being is roughly one hundred years. According to the life-spans on different planets, the standards of living also differ.</div>

Another stage is called <span class="Italic">susupti,</span> or life in an unconscious state, and still another stage occurs after death. In the previous verse the life of awakening was described; that is, the man and the woman were married and enjoyed life for one hundred years. In this verse life in the dream state is described, for the activities Pura�jana accomplished during the day were also reflected at night in the dream state. Pura�jana used to live with his wife for sense enjoyment, and at night this very sense enjoyment was appreciated in different ways. A man sleeps very soundly when he is greatly fatigued, and when a rich man is greatly fatigued he goes to his garden house with many female friends and there enters the water and enjoys their company. Such is the tendency of the living entity within this material world. A living entity is never satisfied with a woman unless he is trained in the system of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya.</span> Generally a man&rsquo;s tendency is to enjoy many women, and even at the very end of life the sex impulse is so strong that even though one is very old he still wants to enjoy the company of young girls. Thus because of the strong sex impulse the living entity becomes more and more involved in this material world.</div>

The system of opening different gates to different places is still evident in old Indian cities. Formerly a capital was surrounded by walls, and one passed through various gates to go to various cities or toward specific directions. In Old Delhi there are still remnants of surrounding walls and various gates known as the Kashmiri Gate, the Lahori Gate, etc. Similarly, in Ahmadabad there is a Delhi Gate. The point of this simile is that the living entity wants to enjoy different types of material opulences, and to this end nature has given him various holes in his body that he can utilize for sense enjoyment.</div>

<div class="First">The gate on the western side of the city was known as &#256;sur&#299; because it was especially meant for the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> The word <span class="Italic">asura</span> refers to those who are interested in sense gratification, specifically in sex life, to which they are overly attracted. Thus Pura�jana, the living entity, enjoys himself to his greatest satisfaction by means of the genitals. Consequently he used to go to the place known as Gr&#257;maka. Material sense gratification is also called <span class="Italic">gr&#257;mya,</span> and the place where sex life is indulged in to a great extent is called Gr&#257;maka. When going to Gr&#257;maka, Pura�jana used to be accompanied by his friend Durmada. The word <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;aya</span> refers to the four bodily necessities of life&mdash;eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The word <span class="Italic">durmadena</span> may be analyzed in this way: <span class="Italic">dur</span> means <span class="Italic">du&#7779;&#7789;a,</span> or &ldquo;sinful,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">mada</span> means &ldquo;madness.&rdquo; Every living entity who is in contact with material nature is called <span class="Italic">mada,</span> or mad.

<A NAME="62134"></A><div id="62134"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">&#257;sur&#299; n&#257;ma pa&#347;c&#257;d dv&#257;&#7717;</span> are significant in another sense. The sunrise is first visible from the eastern side&mdash;the Bay of Bengal&mdash;and gradually it progresses toward the west. It is practically experienced that people in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu Himself has certified: <span class="Italic">pa&#347;cimera loka saba m&#363;&#7693;ha an&#257;c&#257;ra</span> (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">&#256;di</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/adi/10/89?d=1">10.89</a>). The more one goes to the western side, the more he will find people disinterested in spiritual life. He will find them behaving against the Vedic standards. Because of this, people living in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. In this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> it is confirmed: <span class="Italic">&#257;sur&#299; n&#257;ma pa&#347;c&#257;d dv&#257;&#7717;.</span> In other words, the population on the western side is interested in an asuric civilization, that is, a materialistic way of life. Lord Caitanya consequently wanted this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement to be preached on the western side of the world so that people addicted to sense gratification might be benefited by His teachings.</div>

When an ordinary living entity abandons his present body, he passes through the rectum. It is therefore painful. When one is called by nature to evacuate, one also experiences pain. The friend of the living entity who accompanies him through this gate is named Lubdhaka, which means &ldquo;greed.&rdquo; Due to our greed, we eat unnecessarily, and such gluttony causes pain at the time of evacuation. The conclusion is that the living entity feels well if he evacuates properly. This gate is known as Nir&#7771;ti, or the painful gate.</div>

<div class="Translation">Of the many inhabitants of this city, there are two persons named Nirv&#257;k and Pe&#347;ask&#7771;t.

<div class="First">This is a reference to the arms and legs of the living entity. The two legs do not speak, and they are blind. If a person simply trusts his legs to take him walking, he is likely to fall into a hole or bump into something. Thus led by the blind legs, one&rsquo;s life may be placed in jeopardy.</div>
<A NAME="62161"></A><div id="62161"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Of the senses that are working, the hands and legs are very important, but they have no eyes to see. This means that in the hands and legs there are no holes. In the head there are many holes&mdash;two eyes, two nostrils, two ears and one mouth&mdash;but lower down, in the arms and legs, there are no holes. Consequently, the arms and legs have been described as <span class="Italic">andha,</span> blind. Although the living entity has many holes in his body, he nonetheless has to work with his hands and arms. Although the living entity is the master of many other senses, when he has to go somewhere, do something or touch something, he has to use his blind legs and hands.</div>

<div class="First">According to the Vedic conclusion, one&rsquo;s self is situated within the heart. As stated in Vedic language, <span class="Italic">h&#7771;dy ayam &#257;tm&#257; prati&#7779;&#7789;hita&#7717;:</span> the self is situated within the heart. In the material condition, however, the spirit soul is covered by the material qualities&mdash;namely goodness, passion and darkness&mdash;and within the heart these three qualities react. For instance, when one is in goodness, he feels happiness; when one is in passion, he feels satisfaction through material enjoyment; and when one is in darkness, he feels bewilderment. All these activities are of the mind, and they function on the platform of thinking, feeling and willing.</div>
<A NAME="62175"></A><div id="62175"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When the living entity is encircled by wife, children and home, he acts on the mental plane. Sometimes he is very happy, sometimes he is very much satisfied, sometimes he is not satisfied, and sometimes he is bewildered. Bewilderment is called <span class="Italic">moha,</span> illusion. Illusioned by society, friendship and love, the living entity thinks that his so-called society, friendship and love, nationality, community, etc. will give him protection. He does not know that after death he will be thrown into the hands of a very strong material nature that will force him to accept a certain type of body according to his present work. This body may not even be a human body. Thus the living entity&rsquo;s feeling of security in this life in the midst of society, wife and friendship is nothing but illusion. All living entities encaged in various material bodies are illusioned by the present activities of material enjoyment. They forget their real business, which is to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="62176"></A><div id="62176"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Everyone who is not in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness must be considered to be in illusion. One&rsquo;s so-called feelings of happiness and satisfaction resulting from material things are also illusions. Factually neither society, friendship, love nor anything else can save one from the onslaught of the external energy, which is symptomized by birth, death, old age and disease. To get even one living entity out of the illusory condition is very difficult; therefore Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/14?d=1">7.14</a>):</div>

<div class="First">When a living entity is in such bewilderment that he is under the control of his wife, or material intelligence, he has to satisfy the intelligence of his so-called wife and act exactly according to her dictates. Various <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> advise that for material convenience one should keep his wife always satisfied by giving her ornaments and by following her instructions. In this way there will be no trouble in family life. Therefore for one&rsquo;s own social benefit, one is advised to keep his wife satisfied. In this way, when one becomes the servant of his wife, he must act according to the desires of his wife. Thus one becomes more and more entangled. In Bengal it is said that if one becomes an obedient servant of his wife, he loses all reputation. However, the difficulty is that unless one becomes a most obedient servant of his wife, family life becomes disturbed. In the Western countries this disturbance gives rise to the divorce law, and in Eastern countries like India there is separation. Now this disturbance is confirmed by the new introduction of the divorce law in India. Within the heart, the mind is acting, thinking, feeling and willing, and falling under the control of one&rsquo;s wife is the same as falling under the control of material intelligence. Thus one begets children by his wife and becomes entangled in so many activities under the control of mental concoctions.</div>

<div class="Translation">In this way, King Pura�jana was captivated by his nice wife and was thus cheated. Indeed, he became cheated in his whole existence in the material world. Even against that poor foolish King&rsquo;s desire, he remained under the control of his wife, just like a pet animal that dances according to the order of its master.</div>

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">vipralabdha&#7717;</span> is very significant in this verse. <span class="Italic">Vi</span> means &ldquo;specifically,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">pralabdha</span> means &ldquo;obtained.&rdquo; Just to satisfy his desires, the King got the Queen, and thus he became cheated by material existence. Although he was not willing to do so, he remained a pet animal under the control of material intelligence. Just as a pet monkey dances according to the desires of its master, the King danced according to the desires of the Queen. In <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/5/2?d=1">5.5.2</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">mahat-sev&#257;&#7745; dv&#257;ram &#257;hur vimukte&#7717;:</span> if one associates with a saintly person, a devotee, one&rsquo;s path of liberation becomes clear. But if one associates with a woman or with a person who is too much addicted to a woman, his path of bondage becomes completely clear.</div>
<A NAME="62235"></A><div id="62235"> </div>
<div class="Purport">On the whole, for spiritual advancement, one must give up the company of women. This is what is meant by the order of <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the renounced order. Before taking <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> or completely renouncing the material world, one has to practice avoiding illicit sex. Sex life, licit or illicit, is practically the same, but through illicit sex one becomes more and more captivated. By regulating one&rsquo;s sex life there is a chance that one may eventually be able to renounce sex or renounce the association of women. If this can be done, advancement in spiritual life comes very easily.</div>

<div class="Purport">How one becomes captivated by the association of one&rsquo;s dear wife is explained in this chapter by N&#257;rada Muni. Attraction for one&rsquo;s wife means attraction for the material qualities. One who is attracted by the material quality of darkness is in the lowest stage of life, whereas one who is attracted by the material quality of goodness is in a better position. Sometimes we see that when a person is on the platform of material goodness, he is attracted more or less by the cultivation of knowledge. This is, of course, a better position, for knowledge gives one the preference to accept devotional service. Unless one comes to the platform of knowledge, the <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta</span> stage, one cannot advance in devotional service. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/54?d=1">18.54</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.&rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="62239"></A><div id="62239"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The platform of knowledge is advantageous because it is a means by which one may come to the stage of devotional service. However, if one takes to devotional service directly, knowledge is revealed without separate endeavor. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/2/7?d=1">1.2.7</a>):</div>

</div><A NAME="62241"></A><div id="62241"> </div>
<div class="After-Verse">Devotional service automatically reveals actual knowledge of our material existence. One who is sufficiently intelligent immediately attains the stage of renunciation of so-called society, family and love as well as other things. As long as we are attached to society, family and love of the material world, there is no question of knowledge. Nor is there a question of devotional service. By directly taking to devotional service, however, one becomes filled with knowledge and renunciation. In this way one&rsquo;s life becomes successful.</div>
