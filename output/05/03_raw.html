Wanting to have sons, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi underwent severe austerities and penances. He performed many sacrifices along with his wife and worshiped Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, master of all sacrifices. Being very kind to His devotees, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was very pleased with the austerities of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi. He personally appeared before the King in His four-handed feature, and the priests, who were performing the sacrifices, began to offer their prayers unto Him. They prayed for a son like the Lord, and Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u agreed to take birth in the womb of Merudev&#299;, the wife of King N&#257;bhi, and incarnate as King &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva.</div>

<div class="Translation">In the performance of a sacrifice, there are seven transcendental means to obtain the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: (1) by sacrificing valuable things or eatables, (2) by acting in terms of place, (3) by acting in terms of time, (4) by offering hymns, (5) by going through the priest, (6) by offering gifts to the priests and (7) by observing the regulative principles. However, one cannot always obtain the Supreme Lord through this paraphernalia. Nonetheless, the Lord is affectionate to His devotee; therefore when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, who was a devotee, worshiped and offered prayers to the Lord with great faith and devotion and with a pure uncontaminated mind, superficially performing some yaj�a in the line of pravargya, the kind Supreme Personality of Godhead, due to His affection for His devotees, appeared before King N&#257;bhi in His unconquerable and captivating form with four hands. In this way, to fulfill the desire of His devotee, the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested Himself in His beautiful body before His devotee. This body pleases the mind and eyes of the devotees.</div>

<div class="First">It is distinctly mentioned here that the Supreme Personality of Godhead did not appear as an ordinary human being. He appeared before King N&#257;bhi and his associates as the best of all personalities (Puru&#7779;ottama). As stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas:</span> <span class="Italic">Nityo nity&#257;n&#257;&#7745; cetana&#347; cetan&#257;n&#257;m.</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead is also a living being, but He is the supreme living being. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/7?d=1">7.7</a>), Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself says. <span class="Italic">matta&#7717; paratara&#7745; n&#257;nyat ki�cid asti dhana�jaya:</span> &ldquo;O conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no truth superior to Me.&rdquo; No one is more attractive or more authoritative than Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. That is one of the differences between God and an ordinary living being. According to this description of the transcendental body of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Lord can easily be distinguished from all other living beings. Consequently Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi and his priests and associates all offered the Lord obeisances and began to worship Him with various things. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/6/20-23?d=1">6.22</a>), <span class="Italic">ya&#7745; labdhv&#257; c&#257;para&#7745; l&#257;bha&#7745; manyate n&#257;dhika&#7745; tata&#7717;.</span> That is, &ldquo;Upon gaining this, one thinks that there is no greater gain.&rdquo; When one realizes God and sees the Lord face to face, one certainly thinks that he has gained the best of all things. <span class="Italic">Raso &rsquo;py asya para&#7745; d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;v&#257; nivartate:</span> when one experiences a higher taste, his consciousness is fixed. After seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one ceases to be attracted by anything material. One then remains steady in his worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

Materialistic living entities are very much attracted to the modes of material nature, and therefore they are never perfect, but You are above the jurisdiction of all material conceptions. Your name, form and qualities are all transcendental and beyond the conception of experimental knowledge. Indeed, who can conceive of You? In the material world we can perceive only material names and qualities. We have no other power than to offer our respectful obeisances and prayers unto You, the transcendental person. The chanting of Your auspicious transcendental qualities will wipe out the sins of all mankind.

<div class="First">The priests were certainly unhappy to have called the Supreme Lord from Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha for such an insignificant reason. A pure devotee never wants to see the Lord unnecessarily. The Lord is engaged in various activities, and the pure devotee does not want to see Him whimsically, for his own sense gratification. The pure devotee simply depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, and when the Lord is pleased, he can see Him face to face. The Lord is unseen even by demigods like Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva. By calling on the Supreme Lord, the priests of N&#257;bhi Mah&#257;r&#257;ja proved themselves unintelligent; nonetheless, the Lord came out of His causeless mercy.

<div class="Translation">O Vi&#7779;&#7751;udatta, Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased by the great sages at that sacrifice. Consequently the Lord decided to personally exhibit the method of executing religious principles [as observed by brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, sanny&#257;s&#299;s, v&#257;naprasthas and g&#7771;hasthas engaged in rituals] and also satisfy Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi&rsquo;s desire. Consequently He appeared as the son of Merudev&#299; in His original spiritual form, which is above the modes of material nature.</div>

<div class="First">When the Supreme Lord appears or descends as an incarnation within this material world, He does not accept a body made of the three modes of material nature (<span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span>). M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers say that the impersonal God appears in this material world by accepting a body in the <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; states that the word <span class="Italic">&#347;ukla</span> means &ldquo;consisting of <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva.</span>&rdquo; Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u descends in His <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva</span> form. <span class="Italic">&#346;uddha-sattva</span> refers to the <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> which is never contaminated. In this material world, even the mode of goodness (<span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span>) is contaminated by tinges of <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a.</span> When <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> is never contaminated by <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a,</span> it is called <span class="Italic">&#347;uddha-sattva.</span> <span class="Italic">Sattva&#7745; vi&#347;uddha&#7745; vasudeva-&#347;abditam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/4/3/23?d=1">4.3.23</a>). That is the platform of <span class="Italic">vasudeva,</span> whereby the Supreme Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva, can be experienced. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/7?d=1">4.7</a>) &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself says:</div>

<div class="Purport">Unlike ordinary living entities, the Supreme Lord is not forced by the modes of material nature to appear. He appears <span class="Italic">dharm&#257;n dar&#347;ayitu-k&#257;ma</span>&mdash;to show how to execute the functions of a human being. The word <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is meant for human beings and is never used in connection with beings inferior to human beings, such as animals. Unfortunately, without being guided by the Supreme Lord, human beings sometimes manufacture a process of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> by concoction. Actually <span class="Italic">dharma</span> cannot be made by man. <span class="Italic">Dharma&#7745; tu s&#257;k&#7779;&#257;d bhagavat-pra&#7751;&#299;tam.</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/6/3/19?d=1">6.3.19</a>) <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the law is given by the state government. Man-made <span class="Italic">dharma</span> has no meaning. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> refers to man-made <span class="Italic">dharma</span> as <span class="Italic">kaitava-dharma,</span> cheating religion. The Supreme Lord sends an <span class="Italic">avat&#257;ra</span> (incarnation) to teach human society the proper way to execute religious principles. Such religious principles are <span class="Italic">bhakti-m&#257;rga.</span> As the Supreme Lord Himself says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/66?d=1">18.66</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> The son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, appeared on this earth to preach the principles of religion. That will be explained in the Fifth Chapter of this Fifth Canto.</div>
