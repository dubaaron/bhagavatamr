<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter there is a description of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> religious principles in devotional service that transcend religious principles for liberation and the mitigation of material misery. It is stated in this chapter that a human being should not work hard like dogs and hogs for sense gratification. The human life is especially meant for the revival of our relationship with the Supreme Lord, and to this end all kinds of austerities and penances should be accepted. By austere activities, one&rsquo;s heart can be cleansed of material contamination, and as a result one can be situated on the spiritual platform. To attain this perfection, one has to take shelter of a devotee and serve him. Then the door of liberation will be open. Those who are materially attached to women and sense gratification gradually become entangled in material consciousness and suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. Those who are engaged in the general welfare of all and who are not attached to children and family are called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s.</span> Those who are engaged in sense gratification. who act piously or impiously, cannot understand the purpose of the soul. Therefore they should approach a highly elevated devotee and accept him as a spiritual master. By his association, one will be able to understand the purpose of life. Under the instructions of such a spiritual master, one can attain devotional service to the Lord, detachment from material things, and tolerance of material misery and distress. One can then see all living entities equally, and one becomes very eager to know about transcendental subject matters. Endeavoring persistently for the satisfaction of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, one becomes detached from wife, children and home. He is not interested in wasting time. In this way one becomes self-realized. A person advanced in spiritual knowledge does not engage anyone in material activity. And one who cannot deliver another person by instructing him in devotional service should not become a spiritual master, father, mother, demigod or husband. Instructing His one hundred sons, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva advised them to accept their eldest brother, Bharata, as their guide and lord, and thereby serve him. Of all living entities, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> are the best, and above the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> the Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas are situated in an even better position. Serving a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava means serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the characteristics of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and the sacrificial performance executed by Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva for the instruction of the general populace.</div>

<div class="Translation">Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva told His sons: My dear boys, of all the living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool. One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one&rsquo;s heart is purified, and when one attains this position, he attains eternal, blissful life, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva tells His sons about the importance of human life. The word <span class="Italic">deha-bh&#257;k</span> refers to anyone who accepts a material body, but the living entity who is awarded the human form must act differently from animals. Animals like dogs and hogs enjoy sense gratification by eating stool. After undergoing severe hardships all day, human beings are trying to enjoy themselves at night by eating, drinking, having sex and sleeping. At the same time, they have to properly defend themselves. However, this is not human civilization. Human life means voluntarily practicing suffering for the advancement of spiritual life. There is, of course, suffering in the lives of animals and plants, which are suffering due to their past misdeeds. However, human beings should voluntarily accept suffering in the form of austerities and penances in order to attain the divine life. After attaining the divine life, one can enjoy happiness eternally. After all, every living entity is trying to enjoy happiness, but as long as one is encaged in the material body, he has to suffer different kinds of misery. A higher sense is present in the human form. We should act according to superior advice in order to attain eternal happiness and go back to Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="67960"></A><div id="67960"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is significant in this verse that the government and the natural guardian, the father, should educate subordinates and raise them to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Devoid of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, every living being suffers in this cycle of birth and death perpetually. To relieve them from this bondage and enable them to become blissful and happy, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> should be taught. A foolish civilization neglects to teach people how to rise to the platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Without K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness a person is no better than a hog or dog. The instructions of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva are very essential at the present moment. People are being educated and trained to work very hard for sense gratification, and there is no sublime aim in life. A man travels to earn his livelihood, leaving home early in the morning, catching a local train and being packed in a compartment. He has to stand for an hour or two in order to reach his place of business. Then again he takes a bus to get to the office. At the office he works hard from nine to five; then he takes two or three hours to return home. After eating, he has sex and goes to sleep. For all this hardship, his only happiness is a little sex. <span class="Italic">Yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/9/45?d=1">7.9.45</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva clearly states that human life is not meant for this kind of existence, which is enjoyed even by dogs and hogs. Indeed, dogs and hogs do not have to work so hard for sex. A human being should try to live in a different way and should not try to imitate dogs and hogs. The alternative is mentioned. Human life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity and penance. By <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> one can get out of the material clutches. When one is situated in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, devotional service, his happiness is guaranteed eternally. By taking to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> devotional service, one&rsquo;s existence is purified. The living entity is seeking happiness life after life, but he can make a solution to all his problems simply by practicing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Then he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

<div class="Translation">One can attain the path of liberation from material bondage only by rendering service to highly advanced spiritual personalities. These personalities are impersonalists and devotees. Whether one wants to merge into the Lord&rsquo;s existence or wants to associate with the Personality of Godhead, one should render service to the mah&#257;tm&#257;s. For those who are not interested in such activities, who associate with people fond of women and sex, the path to hell is wide open. The mah&#257;tm&#257;s are equipoised. They do not see any difference between one living entity and another. They are very peaceful and are fully engaged in devotional service. They are devoid of anger, and they work for the benefit of everyone. They do not behave in any abominable way. Such people are known as mah&#257;tm&#257;s.<span class="Italic"></span></div>

<div class="First">The human body is like a junction. One may either take the path of liberation or the path leading to a hellish condition. How one can take these paths is described herein. On the path of liberation, one associate; with <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> and on the path of bondage one associates with those attached to sense gratification and women. There are two types of <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s</span>&mdash;the impersonalist and the devotee. Although their ultimate goal is different, the process of emancipation is almost the same. Both want eternal happiness. One seeks happiness in impersonal Brahman, and the other seeks happiness in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As described in the first verse: <span class="Italic">brahma-saukhyam.</span> Brahman means spiritual or eternal; both the impersonalist and the devotee seek eternal blissful life. In any case, it is advised that one become perfect.

<div class="Translation">When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another.</div>

In this way, you should place your faith and love in Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You should detest sense gratification and tolerate the duality of pleasure and pain, which are like the seasonal changes of summer and winter. Try to realize the miserable condition of living entities, who are miserable even in the higher planetary systems. Philosophically inquire about the truth. Then undergo all kinds of austerities and penances for the sake of devotional service. Give up the endeavor for sense enjoyment and engage in the service of the Lord. Listen to discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and always associate with devotees. Chant about and glorify the Supreme Lord, and look upon everyone equally on the spiritual platform. Give up enmity and subdue anger and lamentation. Abandon identifying the self with the body and the home, and practice reading the revealed scriptures. Live in a secluded place and practice the process by which you can completely control your life air, mind and senses. Have full faith in the revealed scriptures, the Vedic literatures, and always observe celibacy. Perform your prescribed duties and avoid unnecessary talks. Always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, acquire knowledge from the right source. Thus practicing bhakti-yoga, you will patiently and enthusiastically be elevated in knowledge and will be able to give up the false ego.</div>

One gradually becomes liberated by practicing as mentioned above. All these prescribed methods enable one to give up the material body (<span class="Italic">li&#7749;ga&#7745; vyapohet</span>) and be situated in his original spiritual body. First of all one has to accept a bona fide spiritual master.

By associating with the devotee, a spiritual standard is maintained. The word <span class="Italic">mad-deva-sa&#7749;g&#257;t</span> is very important.

If he is a father instructing his sons, a spiritual master instructing his disciples, or a king instructing his citizens, he must instruct them as I have advised. Without being angry, he should continue giving instructions, even if his disciple, son or citizen is sometimes unable to follow his order. Ignorant people who engage in pious and impious activities should be engaged in devotional service by all means. They should always avoid fruitive activity. If one puts into the bondage of karmic activity his disciple, son or citizen who is bereft of transcendental vision, how will one profit?

Actually one is supposed to give everything to the Lord because everything belongs to the Lord.

Unless one can do so, he cannot become a spiritual master, husband, father or mother. Similarly, the wives of the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who were performing sacrifices gave up their relatives just to satisfy K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This is an example of a wife rejecting a husband who cannot deliver her from the impending dangers of birth and death. Similarly, Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja rejected his father, and Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja rejected his mother (<span class="Italic">janan&#299; na s&#257; sy&#257;t</span>). The word <span class="Italic">daivam</span> indicates a demigod or one who accepts worship from a dependent. Ordinarily, the spiritual master, husband, father, mother or superior relative accepts worship from an inferior relative, but here &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva forbids this. First the father, spiritual master or husband must be able to release the dependent from repeated birth and death. If he cannot do this, he plunges himself into the ocean of reproachment for his unlawful activities. Everyone should be very responsible and take charge of his dependents just as a spiritual master takes charge of his disciple or a father takes charge of his son. All these responsibilities cannot be discharged honestly unless one can save the dependent from repeated birth and death.</div>

It is inconceivable. I am not forced by nature to accept a particular type of body; I take on a body by My own sweet will. My heart is also spiritual, and I always think of the welfare of My devotees. Therefore within My heart can be found the process of devotional service, which is meant for the devotees. Far from My heart have I abandoned irreligion [adharma] and nondevotional activities. They do not appeal to Me.

<div class="First">In this verse the words <span class="Italic">ida&#7745; &#347;ar&#299;ra&#7745; mama durvibh&#257;vyam</span> are very significant. Generally we experience two energies&mdash;material energy and spiritual energy. We have some experience of the material energy (earth. water, air, fire, ether, mind, intelligence and ego) because in the material world everyone&rsquo;s body is composed of these elements. Within the material body is the spirit soul, but we cannot see it with the material eyes. When we see a body full of spiritual energy, it is very difficult for us to understand how the spiritual energy can have a body. It is said that Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s body is completely spiritual; therefore for a materialistic person, it is very difficult to understand. For a materialistic person, the completely spiritual body is inconceivable. We have to accept the version of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> when our experimental perception cannot understand a subject. As stated in <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">&#299;&#347;vara&#7717; parama&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717; sac-cid-&#257;nanda-vigraha&#7717; </I>[</I>Bs. </span>5.1</I>]<span class="Italic"></I>.</span> The Supreme Lord has a body with form, but that body is not composed of material elements. It is made of spiritual bliss, eternity and living force. By the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord can appear before us in His original spiritual body, but because we have no experience of the spiritual body, we are sometimes bewildered and see the form of the Lord as material. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers are completely unable to conceive of a spiritual body. They say that the spirit is always impersonal, and whenever they see something personal, they take it for granted that it is material. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/11?d=1">9.11</a>) it is said:</div>

<div class="Purport">Unintelligent people think that the Supreme Lord accepts a body composed of the material energy. We can easily understand the material body, but we cannot understand the spiritual body. Therefore &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva says: <span class="Italic">ida&#7745; &#347;ar&#299;ra&#7745; mama durvibh&#257;vyam.</span> In the spiritual world, everyone has a spiritual body. There is no conception of material existence there. In the spiritual world there is only service and the receiving of service. There is only <span class="Italic">sevya, sev&#257;,</span> and <span class="Italic">sevaka</span>&mdash;the person served, the process of service and the servant. These three items are completely spiritual, and therefore the spiritual world is called absolute. There is no tinge of material contamination there. Being completely transcendental to the material conception, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva states that His heart is composed of <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> is explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/66?d=1">18.66</a>): <span class="Italic">sarva-dharm&#257;n parityajya m&#257;m eka&#7745; &#347;ara&#7751;a&#7745; vraja.</span> In the spiritual world, every living entity is surrendered to the Supreme Lord and is completely on the spiritual platform. Although there are servitors, the served and service, all are spiritual and variegated. At the present moment, due to our material conception. everything is <span class="Italic">durvibh&#257;vya,</span> inconceivable. Being the Supreme, the Lord is called &#7770;&#7779;abha, the best. In terms of the Vedic language, <span class="Italic">nityo nity&#257;n&#257;m.</span> We are also spiritual. but we are subordinate. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Lord, is the foremost living entity.

<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">h&#7771;daya</span> indicates the heart, which is also called <span class="Italic">ura&#7717;,</span> the chest. The heart is situated within the chest, and although instrumentally the son is born with the aid of the genitals, he is actually born from within the heart. According to the heart&rsquo;s situation. the semen takes the form of a body. Therefore according to the Vedic system, when one begets a child his heart should be purified through the ritualistic ceremony known as <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na.</span> &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s heart was always uncontaminated and spiritual. Consequently all the sons born from the heart of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva were spiritually inclined. Nonetheless. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva suggested that His eldest son was superior, and He advised the others to serve him. All the brothers of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja were advised by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva to adhere to Bharata&rsquo;s service. The question may be asked why one should be attached to family members, for in the beginning it was advised that one should not be attached to home and family. However, it is also advised, <span class="Italic">mah&#299;yas&#257;m p&#257;da-rajo-&rsquo;bhi&#7779;eka</span>&mdash;one has to serve the <span class="Italic">mah&#299;y&#257;n,</span> one who is very spiritually advanced. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sev&#257;&#7745; dv&#257;ram &#257;hur vimukte&#7717;:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/5/2?d=1">5.5.2</a>] by serving the <span class="Italic">mahat,</span> the exalted devotee, one&rsquo;s path for liberation is open. The family of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva should not be compared to an ordinary materialistic family. Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s eldest son, was specifically very exalted. For this reason the other sons were advised to serve him for his pleasure. That was to be their duty.</div>

<div class="Purport">The Supreme Lord was advising Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to be the chief ruler of the planet. This is the real plan of the Supreme Lord. In the Battle of Kuruk&#7779;etra, we find that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a wanted Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira to be the supreme emperor of this planet. He never wanted Duryodhana to take the post. As stated in the previous verse, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s heart is <span class="Italic">h&#7771;daya&#7745; yatra dharma&#7717;.</span> The characteristic <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is also explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To protect <span class="Italic">dharma</span> (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m</span>), the Lord always wants the ruler of the earth to be a devotee. Then everything goes on nicely for the benefit of everyone. As soon as a demon rules the earth, everything becomes chaotic. At the present moment, the world is inclined toward the democratic process, but the people in general are all contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance. Consequently they cannot select the right person to head the government. The president is selected by the votes of ignorant <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras;</span> therefore another <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> is elected, and immediately the entire government becomes polluted. If people strictly followed the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic"></I>they</span></I> would elect a person who is the Lord&rsquo;s devotee. Then automatically there would be good government. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva therefore recommended Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja as the emperor of this planet. Serving a devotee means serving the Supreme Lord, for a devotee always represents the Lord. When a devotee is in charge, the government is always congenial and beneficial for everyone.</div>

We should not make any particular distinction between the poor and the rich like the foolish worshipers of <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.</span> N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is present in the rich as well as the poor.

Thereafter, although still at home, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva lived like a madman, naked and with disheveled hair.

<div class="Translation">&#7770;&#7779;abhadeva began to tour through cities, villages, mines, countrysides, valleys, gardens, military camps, cow pens, the homes of cowherd men, transient hotels, hills, forests and hermitages. Wherever He traveled, all bad elements surrounded Him, just as flies surround the body of an elephant coming from a forest. He was always being threatened, beaten, urinated upon and spat upon. Sometimes people threw stones, stool and dust at Him, and sometimes people passed foul air before Him. Thus people called Him many bad names and gave Him a great deal of trouble, but He did not care about this, for He understood that the body is simply meant for such an end. He was situated on the spiritual platform, and, being in His spiritual glory, He did not care for all these material insults. In other words, He completely understood that matter and spirit are separate, and He had no bodily conception. Thus, without being angry at anyone, He walked through the whole world alone.</div>

<div class="Translation">O King Par&#299;k&#7779;it, just to show all the yog&#299;s the mystic process, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, the partial expansion of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, performed wonderful activities. Actually He was the master of liberation and was fully absorbed in transcendental bliss, which increased a thousandfold. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, V&#257;sudeva, the son of Vasudeva, is the original source of Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva. There is no difference in Their constitution, and consequently Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva awakened the loving symptoms of crying, laughing and shivering. He was always absorbed in transcendental love. Due to this, all mystic powers automatically approached Him, such as the ability to travel in outer space at the speed of mind, to appear and disappear, to enter the bodies of others, and to see things far, far away. Although He could do all this, He did not exercise these powers.</div>

<div class="First">In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/madhya/19/149?d=1">19.149</a>) it is said:</div>

<div style=" margin-top: 0.125in"><div class="Verse-in-purp">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bhakta&mdash;&mdash;ni&#7779;k&#257;ma, ataeva &lsquo;&#347;&#257;nta&rsquo;<br>bhukti-mukti-siddhi-k&#257;m&#299;&mdash;&mdash;sakali &lsquo;a&#347;&#257;nta&rsquo;</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The word <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta</span> means completely peaceful. Unless all one&rsquo;s desires are fulfilled, one cannot be peaceful. Everyone is trying to fulfill his aspirations and desires, be they material or spiritual. Those in the material world are <span class="Italic">a&#347;&#257;nta</span> (without peace) because they have so many desires to fulfill. The pure devotee, however, is without desire. <span class="Italic">Any&#257;bhil&#257;&#7779;it&#257;-&#347;&#363;nya:</span> a pure devotee is completely free from all kinds of material desire. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s,</span> on the other hand, are simply full of desires because they try to enjoy sense gratification. They are not peaceful in this life, nor the next, during the past, present or future. Similarly, <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s</span> are always aspiring after liberation and trying to become one with the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Yog&#299;s</span> are aspiring after many <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> (powers)&mdash;<span class="Italic">a&#7751;im&#257;, laghim&#257;, pr&#257;pti,</span> etc. However, a devotee is not at all interested in these things because he is fully dependent on the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is <span class="Italic">yoge&#347;vara,</span> the possessor of all mystic powers (<span class="Italic">siddhis</span>), and He is <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma,</span> fully self-satisfied. The <span class="Italic">yoga-siddhis</span> are described in this verse. One can fly in outer space without the aid of a machine, and he can travel at the speed of mind. This means that as soon as a <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> desires to go somewhere within this universe or even beyond this universe, he can do so immediately. One cannot estimate the speed of mind, for within a second the mind can go many millions of miles. Sometimes <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> enter into the bodies of other people and act as they desire when their bodies are not working properly. When the body becomes old, a perfect <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can find a young, able body. Giving up his old body, the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> can enter into the young body and act as he pleases. Being a plenary expansion of Lord V&#257;sudeva, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva possessed all these mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> powers, but He was satisfied with His devotional love of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which was evinced by the ecstatic symptoms, such as crying, laughing and shivering.</div>
