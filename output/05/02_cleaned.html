<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, the character of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra is described. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata went off for spiritual realization, his son &#256;gn&#299;dhra became the ruler of Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa, in accordance with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata&rsquo;s instructions, and maintained its residents with the same affection a father feels for his sons. Once Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra desired to have a son, and therefore he entered a cave of Mandara Mountain to practice austerity. Understanding his desire, Lord Brahm&#257; sent a celestial girl named P&#363;rvacitti to &#256;gn&#299;dhra&rsquo;s hermitage. After dressing herself very attractively, she presented herself before him with various feminine movements, and &#256;gn&#299;dhra was naturally attracted to her. The girl&rsquo;s actions, expressions, smile, sweet words and moving eyes were fascinating to him. &#256;gn&#299;dhra was expert in flattery. Thus he attracted the celestial girl, who was pleased to accept him as her husband because of his mellifluous words. She enjoyed royal happiness with &#256;gn&#299;dhra for many years before returning to her abode in the heavenly planets. In her womb &#256;gn&#299;dhra begot nine sons&mdash;N&#257;bhi, Ki&#7745;puru&#7779;a, Harivar&#7779;a, Il&#257;v&#7771;ta, Ramyaka, Hira&#7751;maya, Kuru, Bhadr&#257;&#347;va and Ketum&#257;la. He gave them nine islands with names corresponding to theirs. &#256;gn&#299;dhra, however, his senses unsatisfied, was always thinking of his celestial wife, and therefore in his next life he was born in her celestial planet. After the death of &#256;gn&#299;dhra, his nine sons married nine daughters of Meru named Merudev&#299;, Pratir&#363;p&#257;, Ugrada&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;, Lat&#257;, Ramy&#257;, &#346;y&#257;m&#257;, N&#257;r&#299;, Bhadr&#257; and Devav&#299;ti.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: After his father, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, departed to follow the path of spiritual life by undergoing austerities, King &#256;gn&#299;dhra completely obeyed his order. Strictly observing the principles of religion, he gave full protection to the inhabitants of Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa as if they were his own begotten sons.</div>

<div class="First">Following the instruction of his father, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra ruled the inhabitants of Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa according to religious principles. These principles are exactly contrary to the modern principles of faithlessness. As clearly stated here, the King protected the citizens the way a father protects his begotten children. How he ruled the citizens is also described here&mdash;<span class="Italic">dharm&#257;vek&#7779;am&#257;&#7751;a&#7717;,</span> strictly according to religious principles. It is the duty of the executive head of a state to see that the citizens strictly follow religious principles. The Vedic religious principles begin with <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> the duties of the four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas.</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> refers to principles given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first principle of <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or religion, is to observe the duties of the four orders as enjoined by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to people&rsquo;s qualities and activities, society should be divided into <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and then again into <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;s, g&#7771;hasthas, v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s.</span> These are religious principles, and it is the duty of the head of state to see that his citizens strictly follow them. He should not merely act officially; he should be like a father who is always a well-wisher of his sons. Such a father strictly observes whether his sons are performing their duties, and sometimes he also punishes them.</div>
<A NAME="67199"></A><div id="67199"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Just contrary to the principles mentioned here, the presidents and chief executives in the age of Kali are simply tax collectors who do not care whether religious principles are observed. Indeed, the chief executives of the present day introduce all kinds of sinful activity, especially illicit sex, intoxication, animal killing and gambling. These sinful activities are now very prominently manifested in India. Although a hundred years ago these four principles of sinful life were strictly prohibited in the families of India, they have now been introduced into every Indian family; therefore they cannot follow religious principles. In contrast to the principles of the kings of old, the modern state is concerned only with propaganda for levying taxes and is no longer responsible for the spiritual welfare of the citizens. The state is now callous to religious principles. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> predicts that in Kali-yuga the government will be entrusted with <span class="Italic">dasyu-dharma,</span> which means the occupational duty of rogues and thieves. Modern heads of state are rogues and thieves who plunder the citizens instead of giving them protection. Rogues and thieves plunder without regard for law, but in this age of Kali, as stated in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the lawmakers themselves plunder the citizens. The next prediction to be fulfilled, which is already coming to pass, is that because of the sinful activities of the citizens and the government, rain will become increasingly scarce. Gradually there will be complete drought and no production of food grains. People will be reduced to eating flesh and seeds, and many good, spiritually inclined people will have to forsake their homes because they will be too harassed by drought, taxation and famine. The K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is the only hope to save the world from such devastation. It is the most scientific and authorized movement for the actual welfare of the whole human society.</div>

<div class="Translation">Desiring to get a perfect son and become an inhabitant of Pit&#7771;loka, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra once worshiped Lord Brahm&#257;, the master of those in charge of material creation.

<div class="First">The King became <span class="Italic">pit&#7771;loka-k&#257;ma,</span> or desirous of being transferred to the planet named Pit&#7771;loka. Pit&#7771;loka is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">y&#257;nti deva-vrat&#257; dev&#257;n pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717; </I>[Bg. </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/25?d=1">9.25</a></I>]</I></span>). To go to this planet, one needs very good sons who can make offerings to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and then offer the remnants to their forefathers. The purpose of the <span class="Italic">&#347;r&#257;ddha</span> ceremony is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, so that after pleasing Him one may offer <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> to one&rsquo;s forefathers and in this way make them happy. The inhabitants of Pit&#7771;loka are generally men of the <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;&#299;ya,</span> or fruitive activities category, who have been transferred there because of their pious activities. They can stay there as long as their descendants offer them <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-pras&#257;da.</span> Everyone in heavenly planets such as Pit&#7771;loka, however, must return to earth after exhausting the effects of his pious acts. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/21?d=1">9.21</a>), <span class="Italic">k&#7779;&#299;&#7751;e pu&#7751;ye martya-loka&#7745; vi&#347;anti:</span> persons who perform pious acts are transferred to higher planets, but when the effects of their pious acts are over, they are again transferred to earth.</div>
<A NAME="67211"></A><div id="67211"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was a great devotee, how could he have begotten a son who desired to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka? Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">pit&#7773;n y&#257;nti pit&#7771;-vrat&#257;&#7717;:</span> persons who desire to go to Pit&#7771;loka are transferred there. Similarly, <span class="Italic">y&#257;nti mad-y&#257;jino &rsquo;pi m&#257;m:</span> persons who desire to be transferred to the spiritual planets, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;halokas, can also go there. Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra was the son of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, he should have desired to be transferred to the spiritual world, Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. Why, then, did he desire to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka? In answer to this, Gosv&#257;m&#299; Giridhara, one of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> commentators, remarks that &#256;gn&#299;dhra was born when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was infatuated by lusty desires. This may be accepted as a fact because sons are begotten with different mentalities according to the time of their conception. According to the Vedic system, therefore, before a child is conceived, the <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ra</span> is performed. This ceremony molds the mentality of the father in such a way that when he plants his seed in the womb of his wife, he will beget a child whose mind will be completely saturated with a devotional attitude. At the present moment, however, there are no such <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sa&#7745;sk&#257;ras,</span> and therefore people generally have a lusty attitude when they beget children. Especially in this age of Kali, there are no <span class="Italic">garbh&#257;dh&#257;na</span> ceremonies; everyone enjoys sex with his wife like a cat or dog. Therefore according to &#347;&#257;stric injunctions, almost all the people of this age belong to the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> category. Of course, although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra had a desire to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka, this does not mean that his mentality was that of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra;</span> he was a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya.</span></div>
<A NAME="67212"></A><div id="67212"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra desired to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka, and therefore he needed a wife because anyone desiring to be transferred to Pit&#7771;loka must leave behind a good son to offer yearly <span class="Italic">pi&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> or <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> from Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. To have a good son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra wanted a wife from a family of demigods. Therefore he went to Mandara Hill. where the women of the demigods generally come, to worship Lord Brahm&#257;. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/12?d=1">4.12</a>) it is said, <span class="Italic">k&#257;&#7749;k&#7779;anta&#7717; karma&#7751;&#257;&#7745; siddhi&#7745; yajanta iha devat&#257;&#7717;:</span> materialists who want quick results in the material world worship demigods. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;-ai&#347;varya-prajepsava&#7717;:</span> those who desire beautiful wives, substantial wealth and many sons worship the demigods, but an intelligent devotee, instead of being entangled by the happiness of this material world in the form of a beautiful wife, material opulence and children, desires to be immediately transferred back home, back to Godhead. Thus he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>

Lord Brahm&#257; could understand Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra&rsquo;s desire because he is as powerful as Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. As Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, situated as Param&#257;tm&#257;, can understand the desire of the living entity, so Lord Brahm&#257; can also understand the living entity&rsquo;s desire, for Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, as a via medium, informs him. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1">1.1.1</a>), <span class="Italic">tene brahma h&#7771;d&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye:</span> Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u informs Lord Brahm&#257; of everything from within his heart. Because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja &#256;gn&#299;dhra specifically worshiped Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord Brahm&#257; was pleased, and he sent P&#363;rvacitti, the Apsar&#257;, to satisfy him.</div>

Although Prince &#256;gn&#299;dhra was controlling his senses, practicing yoga with half-open eyes, he could see her with his lotuslike eyes, and when he heard the sweet tinkling of her bangles, he opened his eyes slightly more and could see that she was just nearby.</div>

<div class="First">It is said that <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> always think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within their hearts. <span class="Italic">Dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti ya&#7745; yogina&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> 12.13.1). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always observed by <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> who practice controlling the venomous senses. As recommended in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> should practice <span class="Italic">samprek&#7779;ya n&#257;sik&#257;gram,</span> keeping their eyes half-open. If the eyes are closed completely, there will be a tendency to sleep. So-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> sometimes practice a fashionable form of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> by closing their eyes and meditating, but we have actually seen such so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> sleeping and snoring while meditating. This is not the practice of <span class="Italic">yoga.</span> To actually practice <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> one should keep his eyes half-open and gaze at the tip of his nose.</div>

<div class="Purport">Although &#256;gn&#299;dhra, the son of Priyavrata, was practicing mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> and trying to control his senses, the tinkling sound of P&#363;rvacitti&rsquo;s ankle bells disturbed his practice. <span class="Italic">Yoga indriya-sa&#7745;yama&#7717;:</span> actual <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice means controlling the senses. One must practice mystic <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> to control the senses, but the sense control of a devotee who fully engages in the service of the Lord with his purified senses (<span class="Italic">h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#7751;a h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a-sevanam</span></I> [Cc. Madhya </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/madhya/19/170?d=1">19.170</a></I>]</I>) can never be disturbed. &#346;r&#299;la Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; therefore stated, <span class="Italic">durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-pa&#7789;al&#299; protkh&#257;ta-da&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;ra-yate</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Caitanya-candr&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> 5). The practice of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is undoubtedly good because it controls the senses, which are like venomous serpents. When one engages in devotional service, however, completely employing all the activities of the senses in the service of the Lord, the venomous quality of the senses is completely nullified. It is explained that a serpent is to be feared because of its poison fangs, but if those fangs are broken. the serpent, although it seems fearsome, is not at all dangerous. Devotees, therefore, may see hundreds and thousands of beautiful women with fascinating bodily movements and gestures but not be allured, whereas such women would make ordinary <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> fall. Even the advanced <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra broke his mystic practice to unite with Menak&#257; and beget a child known as &#346;akuntal&#257;. The practice of mystic <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> therefore, is not sufficiently strong to control the senses. Another example is Prince &#256;gn&#299;dhra, whose attention was drawn to the movements of P&#363;rvacitti, the Apsar&#257;, simply because he heard the tinkling of her ankle bells. In the same way that Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra Muni was attracted by the tinkling bangles of Menak&#257;, Prince &#256;gn&#299;dhra, upon hearing the tinkling bangles of P&#363;rvacitti, immediately opened his eyes to see her beautiful movements as she walked. The prince was also very handsome. As described herein, his eyes were just like the buds of lotus flowers. As he opened his lotuslike eyes, he could immediately see that the Apsar&#257; was present by his side.</div>

<div class="Translation">Like a honeybee, the Apsar&#257; smelled the beautiful and attractive flowers. She could attract the minds and vision of both humans and demigods by her playful movements, her shyness and humility, her glances, the very pleasing sounds that poured from her mouth as she spoke, and the motion of her limbs. By all these qualities, she opened for Cupid, who bears an arrow of flowers, a path of aural reception into the minds of men. When she spoke, nectar seemed to flow from her mouth. As she breathed, the bees, mad for the taste of her breath, tried to hover about her beautiful lotuslike eyes. Disturbed by the bees, she tried to move hastily, but as she raised her feet to walk quickly, her hair, the belt on her hips, and her breasts, which were like water jugs, also moved in a way that made her extremely beautiful and attractive. Indeed, she seemed to be making a path for the entrance of Cupid, who is most powerful. Therefore the prince, completely subdued by seeing her, spoke to her as follows.</div>

<div class="First">How a beautiful woman&rsquo;s movements and gestures, her hair and the structure of her breasts, hips and other bodily features attract the minds not only of men but of demigods also is very finely described in this statement. The words <span class="Italic">divija</span> and <span class="Italic">manuja</span> specifically emphasize that the attraction of feminine gestures is powerful everywhere within this material world, both on this planet and in the higher planetary systems. It is said that the standard of living in the higher planetary systems is thousands and thousands of times higher than the standard of living on this planet. Therefore the beautiful bodily features of the women there are also thousands and thousands of times more attractive than the features of the women on earth. The creator has constructed women in such a way that their beautiful voices and movements and the beautiful features of their hips, their breasts, and the other parts of their bodies attract the members of the opposite sex, both on earth and on other planets, and awaken their lusty desires. When one is controlled by Cupid or the beauty of women, he becomes stunned like matter such as stone. Captivated by the material movements of women, he wants to remain in this material world. Thus one&rsquo;s promotion to the spiritual world is checked simply by seeing the beautiful bodily structure and movements of women. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has therefore warned all devotees to beware of the attraction of beautiful women and materialistic civilization. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu even refused to see Prat&#257;parudra Mah&#257;r&#257;ja because he was a very opulent person in the material world. Lord Caitanya said in this connection, <span class="Italic">ni&#7779;ki&#241;canasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya:</span> those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord because they are very serious about going back home, back to Godhead, should be very careful to avoid seeing the beautiful gestures of women and should also avoid seeing persons who are very rich.</div>

<div class="First">While undergoing severe penances in the forest, &#256;gn&#299;dhra was captivated by the movements of P&#363;rvacitti, the girl sent by Lord Brahm&#257;.

Therefore &#256;gn&#299;dhra, having lost his intelligence, could not distinguish whether P&#363;rvacitti was male or female. He mistook her for a <span class="Italic">muni-putra,</span> the son of a saintly person in the forest, and addressed her as <span class="Italic">muni-varya.</span> Because of her personal beauty, however, he could not believe her to be a boy. He therefore began studying her features. First he saw her two eyebrows, which were so expressive that he wondered whether he or she might be the <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words used in this connection are <span class="Italic">bhagavat-para-devat&#257;y&#257;&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Devat&#257;&#7717;,</span> the demigods, all belong to this material world, whereas Bhagav&#257;n, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is always beyond this material world and is therefore known as <span class="Italic">para-devat&#257;.</span> The material world is certainly created by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> but it is created under the direction of <span class="Italic">para-devat&#257;,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

This material world is like a great forest, and its inhabitants are like forest animals such as deer and tigers meant to be killed. The killers are the eyebrows of beautiful women. Captivated by the beauty of the fair sex, all the men of the world are killed by bows without strings, but cannot see how they are killed by <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> It is a fact, however, that they are being killed (<span class="Italic">bh&#363;tv&#257; bh&#363;tv&#257; pral&#299;yate</span>).

Therefore he requested, &ldquo;Please uncover them so that I can see what you are carrying. Rest assured that I shall not take it away.

<div class="First">&#256;gn&#299;dhra appreciated the wonderful beauty of P&#363;rvacitti. Indeed, he was surprised to see such exceptional beauty, which must have been the result of past austerities and penances. He therefore asked the girl whether she had achieved such beauty just to break the penances and austerities of others. He thought that Lord Brahm&#257;, the creator of the universe, might have been pleased with him and might therefore have sent her to become his wife. He requested P&#363;rvacitti to become his wife so that together they could perform austerities and penances in family life. In other words, a suitable wife helps her husband perform penances and austerities in household life if both of them are on the same elevated platform of spiritual understanding. Without spiritual understanding, husband and wife cannot be equally situated. Lord Brahm&#257;, the creator of the universe, is interested in good progeny. Therefore unless he is pleased, one cannot get a suitable wife. In fact, Lord Brahm&#257; is worshiped in marriage ceremonies. In India even today, wedding invitations are still issued with a picture of Lord Brahm&#257; on the face of the card.</div>
