<A NAME="70277"></A><div id="70277"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> Ja&#7693;a Bharata became very kind to King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a, and to disassociate him from the material world, he spoke figuratively of the forest of the material world. He explained that this material world is like a great forest in which one becomes entangled due to association with material life. In this forest there are plunderers (the six senses) as well as carnivorous animals like jackals, wolves and lions (wife, children and other relatives) who are always anxious to suck the blood from the head of the family. The forest plunderers and the carnivorous blood-sucking animals combine to exploit the energy of a man within this material world. In this forest there is also a black hole, covered by grass, into which one may fall. Coming into the forest and being captivated by so many material attractions, one identifies himself with this material world, society, friendship, love and family. Having lost the path and not knowing where to go, being harassed by animals and birds, one is also victimized by many desires. Thus one works very hard within the forest and wanders here and there. He becomes captivated by temporary happiness and becomes aggrieved by so-called distress. Actually one simply suffers in the forest from so-called happiness and distress. Sometimes he is attacked by a snake (deep sleep), and due to the snakebite he loses consciousness and becomes puzzled and bewildered about discharging his duties. Sometimes he is attracted by women other than his wife, and thus be thinks he enjoys extramarital love with another woman. He is attacked by various diseases, by lamentation and by summer and winter. Thus one within the forest of the material world suffers the pains of material existence. Expecting to become happy, the living entity changes his position from one place to another, but actually a materialistic person within the material world is never happy. Being constantly engaged in materialistic activities, he is always disturbed. He forgets that one day he has to die. Although he suffers severely, being illusioned by the material energy, he still hankers after material happiness. In this way he completely forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

He could understand that his illusion was over, and he begged pardon from Ja&#7693;a Bharata for his misbehavior.

<div class="Translation">Ja&#7693;a Bharata, who had fully realized Brahman, continued: My dear King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a, the living entity wanders on the path of the material world, which is very difficult for him to traverse, and he accepts repeated birth and death. Being captivated by the material world under the influence of the three modes of material nature (sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a and tamo-gu&#7751;a), the living entity can see only the three fruits of activities under the spell of material nature. These fruits are auspicious, inauspicious and mixed. He thus becomes attached to religion, economic development, sense gratification and the monistic theory of liberation (merging with the Supreme). He works very hard day and night exactly like a merchant who enters a forest to acquire some articles to sell later for profit. However, he cannot really achieve happiness within this material world.</div>

<div class="First">One can very easily understand how difficult and insurmountable the path of sense gratification is. Not knowing what the path of sense gratification is, one becomes implicated in the repetition of birth and accepts different types of bodies again and again. Thus one suffers in material existence. In this life one may think that he is very happy being an American, Indian, Englishman or German, but in the next life one has to accept another body among 8,400,000 species. The next body has to be immediately accepted according to <span class="Italic">karma.</span> One will be forced to accept a certain type of body, and protesting will not help. That is the stringent law of nature. Due to the living entity&rsquo;s ignorance of his eternal blissful life, he becomes attracted to material activities under the spell of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> In this world, he can never experience happiness, yet he works very hard to do so. This is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">O King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a, in this forest of material existence there are six very powerful plunderers. When the conditioned soul enters the forest to acquire some material gain, the six plunderers misguide him. Thus the conditioned merchant does not know how to spend his money, and it is taken away by these plunderers. Like tigers, jackals and other ferocious animals in a forest that are ready to take away a lamb from the custody of its protector, the wife and children enter the heart of the merchant and plunder him in so many ways.</div>

<div class="First">In the forest there are many plunderers, dacoits, jackals and tigers. The jackals are compared to one&rsquo;s wife and children. In the dead of night, jackals cry very loudly, and similarly one&rsquo;s wife and children in this material world also cry like jackals. The children say, &ldquo;Father, this is wanted; give me this. I am your dear son.&rdquo; Or the wife says, &ldquo;I am your dear wife. Please give me this. This is now needed.&rdquo; In this way one is plundered by the thieves in the forest. Not knowing the aim of human life, one is constantly being misguided. The aim of life is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u (<span class="Italic">na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha-gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;um</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/31?d=1">7.5.31</a>]). Everyone works very hard to earn money, but no one knows that his real self-interest is in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead of spending money for advancing the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, one spends his hard-earned money on clubs, brothels, liquor, slaughterhouses and so forth. Due to sinful activities, one becomes implicated in the process of transmigration and thus has to accept one body after another. Being thus absorbed in a distressed condition, one never attains happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation">In this forest there are dense bowers composed of thickets of bushes, grass and creepers.

<div class="First">The material household is actually a hole of fruitive activity. To earn a livelihood one engages in different industries and trades, and sometimes one performs great sacrifices to go to higher planetary systems. Apart from this, at least everyone is engaged in earning a livelihood in some profession or occupation. In these dealings, one has to meet many undesirable people, and their behavior is compared to the biting of mosquitoes. This creates very undesirable conditions. Even in the midst of these disturbances, one imagines that he is going to construct a grand house and live there permanently, although he knows that he cannot. Gold is compared to a quickly fleeting fiend, which appears like a meteor in the sky. It displays itself for a moment and is then gone. Generally <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are attracted to gold or money, but these are compared herein to ghosts and witches.</div>

His only enjoyment in material life is sexual intercourse. Therefore <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are attracted to women as friends or wives. Indeed, they cannot work without sex.

Those who strictly follow the rules and regulations of householder life engage in sex only once a month, at the end of the menstrual period. As one looks forward to this opportunity, his eyes are overwhelmed by the beauty of his wife. Thus it is said that the whirlwind covers the eyes with dust. Such a lusty person does not know that all his material activities are being observed by different demigods, especially the sun-god, and are being recorded for the <span class="Italic">karma</span> of one&rsquo;s next body. Astrological calculations are called <span class="Italic">jyoti-&#347;&#257;stra.</span> Because the <span class="Italic">jyoti,</span> or effulgence, in the material world comes from the different stars and planets, the science is called <span class="Italic">jyoti-&#347;&#257;stra,</span> the science of the luminaries. By the calculations of <span class="Italic">jyoti,</span> our future is indicated. In other words, all the luminaries&mdash;the stars, sun and moon&mdash;witness the activities of the conditioned soul. Thus he is awarded a particular type of body. A lusty, person whose eyes are covered by the dust of the whirlwind or material existence does not at all consider that his activities are being observed by different stars and planets and are being recorded. Not knowing this, the conditioned soul commits all kinds of sinful activities for the satisfaction of his lusty desires.</div>

This is the nature of the world; one cannot avoid mental distress due to the backbiting of envious people. Being very much aggrieved, sometimes one goes to a sinful person for help, but he has no means to help because he has no intelligence. Thus the living entity is disappointed. This is like running after a mirage in the desert in an effort to find water. Such activities do not produce any tangible results. Due to being directed by the illusory energy, a conditioned soul suffers in so many ways.</div>

<div class="Purport">Thus people are trying to become happy within the material world, but this is like trying to be happy in a forest fire. No one need go to a forest to set it ablaze: fire takes place automatically. Similarly, no one wants to be unhappy in family life or worldly life, but by the laws of nature unhappiness and distress are forced upon everyone. To become dependent on another&rsquo;s maintenance is very degrading; therefore, according to the Vedic system, everyone should live independently. Only the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> are unable to live independently. They are obliged to serve someone for maintenance.

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">gandharva-puram</span> is very significant in this verse. Sometimes in the forest a very big castle appears, and this is called a castle in the air. Actually this castle does not exist anywhere but in one&rsquo;s imagination. This is called <span class="Italic">gandharva-pura.</span> In the material forest, the conditioned soul sometimes contemplates great castles and skyscrapers, and he wastes his energy for such things, hoping to live in them very peacefully with his family forever. However, the laws of nature do not allow this. When he enters such castles, he temporarily thinks that he is very happy, even though his happiness is impermanent. His happiness may last for a few years, but because the owner of the castle has to leave the castle at the time of death, everything is eventually lost. This is the way of worldly transactions. Such happiness is described by Vidy&#257;pati as the happiness one derives upon seeing a drop of water in the desert. The desert is heated by scorching sunshine, and if we want to reduce the desert temperature, we need huge amounts of water&mdash;millions and millions of gallons. What effect will one drop have? Water certainly has value, but one drop of water cannot reduce the heat of the desert. In this material world everyone is ambitious, but the heat is very scorching. What will an imaginary castle in the air do to help? &#346;r&#299;la Vidy&#257;pati has therefore sung: <span class="Italic">t&#257;&#7789;ala saikate, v&#257;ri-bindu-sama, suta-mita-rama&#7751;i-sam&#257;je.</span> The happiness of family life, friends and society is compared to a drop of water in the scorching desert. The entire material world is busy trying to attain happiness because happiness is the prerogative of the living being. Unfortunately, due to falling in contact with the material world, the living entity simply struggles for existence. Even if one becomes happy for a while, a very powerful enemy may plunder everything. There are many instances in which big businessmen suddenly become paupers in the street. Yet the nature of material existence is such that foolish people are attracted to these transactions and they forget the real business of self-realization.</div>

<div class="First">The ambitious conditioned soul wants to be very happy in this material world with his family, but he is compared to a traveler in the forest who desires to climb a hill full of thorns and small stones. As stated in the previous verse, the happiness derived from society, friendship and love is like a drop of water in the scorching heat of the desert. One may want to become very great and powerful in society, but this is like attempting to climb a hill full of thorns. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura compares one&rsquo;s family to high mountains. Becoming happy in their association is like a hungry man&rsquo;s endeavoring to climb a mountain full of thorns. Almost 99.9 percent of the population is unhappy in family life, despite all the attempts being made to satisfy the family members. In the Western countries, due to the dissatisfaction of the family members. there is actually no family life. There are many cases of divorce, and out of dissatisfaction, the children leave the protection of their parents. Especially in this age of Kali, family life is being reduced. Everyone is becoming self-centered because that is the law of nature. Even if one has sufficient money to maintain a family, the situation is such that no one is happy in family life. Consequently according to the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution, one has to retire from family life in middle age: <span class="Italic">pa&#241;c&#257;&#347;ordhva&#7745; vana&#7745; vrajet.</span> One should voluntarily retire from family life at the age of fifty and go to V&#7771;nd&#257;vana or a forest. This is recommended by &#346;r&#299;la Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/5?d=1">7.5.5</a>):</div>

<div class="After-Verse">There is no benefit in transferring from one forest to another. One must go to the V&#7771;nd&#257;vana forest and take shelter of Govinda. That will make one happy. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is therefore constructing a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-Balar&#257;ma temple to invite its members as well as outsiders to come and live peacefully in a spiritual atmosphere. That will help one become elevated to the transcendental world and return home, back to Godhead. Another sentence in this verse is very significant: <span class="Italic">kau&#7789;umbika&#7717; krudhyati vai jan&#257;ya.</span> When one&rsquo;s mind is disturbed in so many ways, he satisfies himself by becoming angry with his poor wife and children. The wife and children are naturally dependent on the father, but the father, being unable to maintain the family properly, becomes mentally distressed and therefore chastises the family members unnecessarily. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (12.2.9): <span class="Italic">&#257;cchinna-d&#257;ra-dravi&#7751;&#257; y&#257;syanti giri-k&#257;nanam.</span> Being disgusted with family life, one separates from the family by divorce or some other means. If one has to separate, why not separate willingly? Systematic separation is better than forced separation. Forced separation cannot make anyone happy, but by mutual consent or by the Vedic arrangement one must separate from his family affairs at a certain age and fully depend on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. This makes one&rsquo;s life successful.</div>

Please receive the holy name of the Lord, the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> and awaken.&rdquo; The <span class="Ref_Italic">Ka&#7789;ha Upani&#7779;ad</span> (1.3.14) also says, <span class="Italic">utti&#7779;&#7789;ha j&#257;grata pr&#257;pya var&#257;n nibodhata:</span> &ldquo;O living entity, you are sleeping in this material world. Please get up and take advantage of your human form of life.&rdquo; The sleeping condition means loss of all knowledge. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/69?d=1">2.69</a>) it is also said, <span class="Italic">y&#257; ni&#347;&#257; sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;n&#257;&#7745; tasy&#257;&#7745; j&#257;garti sa&#7745;yam&#299;:</span> &ldquo;What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled.&rdquo; Even in the higher planets, everyone is under the spell of the illusory energy. No one is really interested in the real values of life. The sleeping condition, called <span class="Italic">k&#257;la-sarpa</span> (the time factor), keeps the conditioned soul in a state of ignorance, and therefore pure consciousness is lost. In the forest there are many blind wells, and if one falls down in one there is no chance of being rescued. In a state of sleep, one remains perpetually bitten by some animals, especially snakes.</div>

<div class="Translation">Sometimes, in order to have a little insignificant sex enjoyment, one searches after debauched women. In this attempt, one is insulted and chastised by the women&rsquo;s kinsmen. This is like going to take honey from a beehive and being attacked by the bees. Sometimes, after spending lots of money, one may acquire another woman for some extra sense enjoyment. Unfortunately, the object of sense enjoyment, the woman, is taken away or kidnapped by another debauchee.</div>

<div class="First">In a great forest, honeycombs are very important. People often go there to collect honey from the combs, and sometimes the bees attack and punish them. In human society, those who are not K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious remain in the forest of material life simply for the honey of sex life. Such debauchees are not at all satisfied with one wife. They want many women. Day after day, with great difficulty, they try to secure such women, and sometimes, while trying to taste this kind of honey, one is attacked by a woman&rsquo;s kinsmen and chastised very heavily. By bribing others, one may secure another woman for enjoyment, yet another debauchee may kidnap her or offer her something better. This woman hunting is going on in the forest of the material world, sometimes legally, and sometimes illegally. Consequently in this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement the devotees are forbidden to have illicit sex. Thus they avoid so many difficulties. One should remain satisfied with one woman, being duly married. One can satisfy one&rsquo;s lusty desires with his wife without creating disturbances in society and being punished for doing so.</div>

<div class="First">In the forest of the material world there are many animals and birds, trees and creepers. Sometimes the living entity wants to take shelter of the creepers; in other words, he wants to be happy by being embraced by the creeperlike arms of his wife. Within the creepers there are many chirping birds; this indicates that he wants to satisfy himself by hearing the sweet voice of his wife. In old age, however, he sometimes becomes afraid of imminent death, which is compared to a roaring lion. To save himself from the lion&rsquo;s attack, he takes shelter of some bogus <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s, yog&#299;s,</span> incarnations, pretenders and cheaters. Being misled by the illusory energy in this way, he spoils his life. It is said, <span class="Italic">hari&#7745; vin&#257; m&#7771;ti&#7745; na taranti:</span> no one can be saved from the imminent danger of death without taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word <span class="Italic">hari</span> indicates the lion as well as the Supreme Lord. To be saved from the hands of Hari, the lion of death, one must take shelter of the supreme Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People with a poor fund of knowledge take shelter of nondevotee cheaters and pretenders in order to be saved from the clutches of death. In the forest of the material world, the living entity first of all wants to be very happy by taking shelter of the creeperlike arms of his wife and hearing her sweet voice. Later, he sometimes takes shelter of so-called <span class="Italic">gurus and s&#257;dhus</span> who are like crane, herons and vultures. Thus he is cheated both ways by not taking shelter of the Supreme Lord.</div>

Money and women are the basic principles of material attachment. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu therefore advised those who are actually serious about returning back to Godhead to give up money and women in order to be fit to enter the kingdom of God. Money and women can be fully utilized in the service of the Lord, and one who can utilize them in this way can become freed from material bondage. <span class="Italic">Sat&#257;&#7745; prasa&#7749;g&#257;n mama v&#299;rya-sa&#7745;vido bhavanti h&#7771;t-kar&#7751;a-ras&#257;yan&#257;&#7717; kath&#257;&#7717;</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bh&#257;g.</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/3/25/25?d=1">3.25.25</a>). Only in the association of devotees can one relish the glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just through a little association with a pure devotee. one can become successful in his journey back to Godhead.</div>
