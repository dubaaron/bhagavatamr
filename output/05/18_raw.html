<A NAME="72018"></A><div id="72018"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; describes the different <span class="Italic">var&#7779;as</span> of Jamb&#363;dv&#299;pa and the incarnation of the Supreme Lord worshiped in each. The predominating ruler of Bhadr&#257;&#347;va-var&#7779;a is Bhadra&#347;rav&#257;. He and his many servants always worship the incarnation known as Lord Hayagr&#299;va. At the end of each <span class="Italic">kalpa,</span> when the demon Aj�&#257;na steals the Vedic knowledge, Lord Hayagr&#299;va appears and preserves it. Then He delivers it to Lord Brahm&#257;. In the land known as Hari-var&#7779;a, the exalted devotee Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja worships Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva. (The appearance of Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva is described in the Seventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span>) Following in the footsteps of Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, the inhabitants of Hari-var&#7779;a always worship Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva to receive from Him the benediction of being engaged in His loving service. In the tract of land known as Ketum&#257;la-var&#7779;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Lord H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a) appears in the form of Cupid. The goddess of fortune and the demigods living there engage in His service day and night. Manifesting Himself in sixteen parts, Lord H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a is the source of all encouragement, strength and influence. The conditioned living entity has the defect of being always fearful, but simply by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can rid himself of this defect of material life. Therefore the Lord alone can be addressed as master. In the tract of land known as Ramyaka-var&#7779;a, Manu and all the inhabitants worship Matsyadeva to this very day. Matsyadeva, whose form is pure goodness, is the ruler and maintainer of the whole universe, and as such He is the director of all the demigods, headed by King Indra. In Hira&#7751;maya-var&#7779;a Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u has assumed the form of a tortoise (K&#363;rma <span class="Italic">m&#363;rti</span>) and is worshiped there by Aryam&#257;, along with all the other residents. Similarly, in the tract of land known as Uttarakuru-var&#7779;a, Lord &#346;r&#299; Hari has assumed the form of a boar, and in that form He accepts service from all the inhabitants living there.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">All the information in this chapter can be fully realized by one who associates with devotees of the Lord. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> it is recommended that one associate with devotees. This is better than residing on the banks of the Ganges. In the hearts of pure devotees reside all good sentiments as well as all the superior qualities of the demigods. In the hearts of nondevotees, however, there cannot be any good qualities, for such people are simply enchanted by the external, illusory energy of the Lord. Following in the footsteps of devotees, one should know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only worshipable Deity. Everyone should accept this proposal and worship the Lord. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>), <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;:</span> the purpose of studying all Vedic literature is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If after studying all the Vedic literature, one does not awaken his dormant love for the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has labored for nothing. He has simply wasted his time. Lacking attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he remains attached to family life in this material world. Thus the lesson of this chapter is that one should get out of family life and completely take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">Foolish materialistic persons do not know how they are being controlled and punished at every step by the laws of nature. They think they are very happy in the conditioned state of material life, not knowing the purpose of repeated birth, death, old age and disease. Therefore in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/15?d=1">7.15</a>) Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a describes such materialistic persons as <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has</span> (rascals): <span class="Italic">na m&#257;&#7745; du&#7779;k&#7771;tino m&#363;&#7693;h&#257;&#7717; prapadyante nar&#257;dham&#257;&#7717;.</span> These <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has</span> do not know that if they want to purify themselves, they must worship Lord V&#257;sudeva (K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a) by performing penances and austerities. This purification is the aim of human life. This life is not meant for blind indulgence in sense gratification. In the human form, the living being must engage himself in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness to purify his existence: <span class="Italic">tapo divya&#7745; putrak&#257; yena sattva&#7745; &#347;uddhyet.</span> This is the instruction of King &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva to His sons.

Unobstructed happiness is called <span class="Italic">brahma-saukhya,</span> spiritual happiness. Although we may get some so-called happiness in this material world, that happiness is temporary. The foolish materialists cannot understand this. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja points out, <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;-sukh&#257;ya bharam udvahato vim&#363;&#7693;h&#257;n:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/9/43?d=1">7.9.43</a>] merely for temporary materialistic happiness, these rascals are making huge arrangements, and thus they are baffled life after life.</div>

<div class="Translation">Alas! How wonderful it is that the foolish materialist does not heed the great danger of impending death! He knows that death will surely come, yet he is nevertheless callous and neglectful. If his father dies, he wants to enjoy his father&rsquo;s property, and if his son dies, he wants to enjoy his son&rsquo;s possessions as well. In either case, he heedlessly tries to enjoy material happiness with the acquired money.</div>

<div class="First">Material happiness means to have good facilities for eating, sleeping, sexual intercourse and defense. Within this world, the materialistic person lives only for these four principles of sense gratification, not caring for the impending danger of death. After his father&rsquo;s death, a son tries to inherit his money and use it for sense gratification. Similarly, one whose son dies tries to enjoy the possessions of his son. Sometimes the father of a dead son even enjoys his son&rsquo;s widow. Materialistic persons behave in this way. Thus &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; says, &ldquo;How wonderful are these pastimes of material happiness transacted by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead!&rdquo; In other words, materialistic persons want to commit all kinds of sinful activities, but without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one can do anything. Why does the Supreme Personality of Godhead permit sinful activities? The Supreme Lord does not want any living being to act sinfully, and He begs him through his good conscience to refrain from sin. But when someone insists upon acting sinfully, the Supreme Lord gives him the sanction to act at his own risk (<span class="Italic">matta&#7717; sm&#7771;tir j�&#257;nam apohana&#7745; ca</I></span> [Bg. </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a></I>]</I>). No one can do anything without the sanction of the Lord, but He is so kind that when the conditioned soul persists in doing something, the Lord permits the individual soul to act at his own risk.</div>

<div class="Purport">According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, sons always outlive their fathers in other planetary systems and other lands in this universe, especially on Svargaloka. However, on this planet earth a son often dies before his father, and the materialistic father is pleased to enjoy the possessions of his son. Neither the father nor the son can see the reality&mdash;that both of them are awaiting death. When death comes, however, all their plans for material enjoyment are finished.</div>

<div class="First">Not only does the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead act on the conditioned soul within this material world, but sometimes it also acts on the most advanced learned scholars, who factually know the constitutional position of this material world through realization. As soon as someone thinks, &ldquo;I am this material body (<span class="Italic">aha&#7745; mameti</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/5/5/8?d=1">5.5.8</a>]) and everything in relationship with this material body is mine,&rdquo; he is in illusion (<span class="Italic">moha</span>).

A liberated soul is a person who has sufficient knowledge of this material world and is therefore unattached to the bodily conception of life. But because of association with the modes of material nature for a very long time, even liberated souls sometimes become captivated by the illusory energy due to inattentiveness in the transcendental position. Therefore Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/14?d=1">7.14</a>), <span class="Italic">m&#257;m eva ye prapadyante m&#257;y&#257;m et&#257;&#7745; taranti te:</span> &ldquo;Only those who surrender unto Me can overcome the influence of the material energy.&rdquo; Therefore no one should think of himself as a liberated person immune to the influence of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> Everyone should very cautiously execute devotional service by rigidly following regulative principles. Thus he will remain fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise, a little inattention will create havoc. We have already seen an example of this in the case of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was undoubtedly a great devotee, but because he turned his attention slightly toward a small deer, he had to suffer two more births, one as a deer and another as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> Ja&#7693;a Bharata. Afterward he was liberated and went back home, back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="Purport">The Lord is always prepared to excuse His devotee, but if a devotee takes advantage of the Lord&rsquo;s leniency and purposefully commits mistakes again and again, the Lord will certainly punish him by letting him fall down into the clutches of the illusory energy. In other words, theoretical knowledge acquired by studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is insufficient to protect one from the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> One must strongly adhere to the lotus feet of the Lord in devotional service. Then one&rsquo;s position is secure.</div>

Therefore we should always offer our prayers to Lord N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva, who killed Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, the personification of material desire. <span class="Italic">Hira&#7751;ya</span> means &ldquo;gold,&rdquo; and <span class="Italic">ka&#347;ipu</span> means &ldquo;a soft cushion or bed.&rdquo; Materialistic persons always desire to make the body comfortable, and for this they require huge amounts of gold. Thus Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was the perfect representative of materialistic life.

Any devotee aspiring to be free of material desires should offer his respectful prayers to N&#7771;si&#7745;hadeva as Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did in this verse.</div>

He always thought of the welfare of mischievous persons like his father, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not ask for anything for himself; rather, he prayed for the Lord to excuse his demoniac father.

The first desire expressed in his prayer is <span class="Italic">svasty astu vi&#347;vasya:</span> &ldquo;Let there be good fortune throughout the entire universe.&rdquo; Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja thus requested the Lord to be merciful to everyone, including his father, a most envious person. According to C&#257;&#7751;akya Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita, there are two kinds of envious living entities: one is a snake, and the other is the man like Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu, who is by nature envious of everyone, even of his father or son. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was envious of his little son Prahl&#257;da, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja asked a benediction for the benefit of his father. Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu was very envious of devotees, but Prahl&#257;da wished that his father and other demons like him would give up their envious nature by the grace of the Lord and stop harassing the devotees (<span class="Italic">khala&#7717; pras&#299;dat&#257;m</span>). The difficulty is that the <span class="Italic">khala</span> (envious living entity) is rarely pacified. One kind of <span class="Italic">khala,</span> the snake, can be pacified simply by <span class="Italic">mantras</span> or by the action of a particular herb (<span class="Italic">mantrau&#7779;adhi-va&#347;a&#7717; sarpa&#7717; khalakena niv&#257;ryate</span>). An envious person, however, cannot be pacified by any means. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays that all envious persons may undergo a change of heart and think of the welfare of others.</div>
<A NAME="72148"></A><div id="72148"> </div>
<div class="Purport">If the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement spreads all over the world, and if by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a everyone accepts it, the thinking of envious people will change. Everyone will think of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays, <span class="Italic">&#347;iva&#7745; mitho dhiy&#257;.</span> In material activities, everyone is envious of others, but in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, no one is envious of anyone else; everyone thinks of the welfare of others. Therefore Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays that everyone&rsquo;s mind may become gentle by being fixed at the lotus feet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (<span class="Italic">bhajat&#257;d adhok&#7779;aje</span>).

Antya </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/antya/20/12?d=1">20.12</a></I>]</span></I>). Materialists always think of sense gratification, but Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja prays that the Lord&rsquo;s mercy will change their minds and they will stop thinking of sense gratification. If they think of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a always, everything will be all right. Some people argue that if everyone thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a in that way, the whole universe would be vacated because everyone would go back home, back to Godhead. However, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says that this is impossible because the living entities are innumerable. If one set of living entities is actually delivered by the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, another set will fill the entire universe.</div>

Therefore all the great saints in the devotional line very strongly recommend the process of hearing. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu introduced the congregational chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra</span> to give everyone a chance to hear K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s holy name, for simply by hearing Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare, one becomes purified (<span class="Italic">ceto-darpa&#7751;a-m&#257;rjanam</I> [Cc.

While the devotee engages in devotional service, the passionate and ignorant modes of material nature are gradually vanquished, and then he acts only in the mode of goodness.

<div class="First">In this verse, Lak&#7779;m&#299;dev&#299; (Ram&#257;) shows compassion toward women who worship the Lord for the benediction of possessing a good husband. Although such women desire to be happy with children, wealth, a long duration of life and everything dear to them, they cannot possibly do so. In the material world, a so-called husband is dependent on the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of a woman whose husband, being dependent on the result of his own fruitive actions, cannot maintain his wife, her children, her wealth or her duration of life. Therefore, factually the only real husband of all women is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the supreme husband. Because the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> were liberated souls, they understood this fact. Therefore they rejected their material husbands and accepted K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as their real husband. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the real husband not only of the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s,</span> but of every living entity. Everyone should perfectly understand that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the real husband of all living entities, who are described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> (female), not <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> (male). In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/10/12-13?d=1">10.12</a>), only K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is addressed as <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a:</span></div>

Therefore any woman who seeks a material husband for her protection, or any man who desires to become the husband of a woman, is under illusion. To become a husband means to maintain a wife and children nicely by supplying wealth and security. However, a material husband cannot possibly do this, for he is dependent on his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> <span class="Italic">Karma&#7751;&#257;-daiva-netre&#7751;a:</span> his circumstances are determined by his past fruitive activities. Therefore if one proudly thinks he can protect his wife, he is under illusion. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the only husband, and therefore the relationship between a husband and wife in this material world cannot be absolute. Because we have the desire to marry, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a mercifully allows the so-called husband to possess a wife, and the wife to possess a so-called husband, for mutual satisfaction.

<div class="First">Here the meaning of husband or guardian is clearly explained. people want to become a husband, a guardian, a governor or a political leader without knowing the actual meaning of such a superior position. There are many people all over the world&mdash;indeed, throughout the universe&mdash;who claim for some time that they are husbands, political leaders or guardians, but in due course of time the Supreme Lord desires their removal from their posts, and their careers are immediately finished.

<div class="First">In this verse the goddess of fortune, Lak&#7779;m&#299;dev&#299;, clearly states that she does not bestow her favor on any materialistic person.

However, My Lord is Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, a cowherd boy engaged in tending cows. Why is it that Lak&#7779;m&#299;, being such a chaste wife, wants to associate with My Lord? Just to associate with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, Lak&#7779;m&#299; abandoned all transcendental happiness in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha and for a long time accepted vows and regulative principles and performed unlimited austerities.&rsquo;</div>

Rather, it was in great fun that the goddess of fortune wanted to associate with Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The goddess of fortune considered that her vow of chastity would not be damaged by her relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Rather, by associating with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a she could enjoy the benefit of the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance.

The authorities of Vedic knowledge met Lord R&#257;macandra in Da&#7751;&#7693;ak&#257;ra&#7751;ya, and by their penances and austerities, they were allowed to enter into the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance.

<A NAME="72374"></A><div id="72374"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&ldquo;Lord Caitanya replied, &lsquo;Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a has a specific characteristic. He attracts everyone&rsquo;s heart by the mellow of His personal conjugal love. By following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of the planet known as Vrajaloka or Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, one can attain the shelter of the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. However, the inhabitants of that planet do not know that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unaware that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the Supreme Lord, the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana like Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Ya&#347;od&#257;dev&#299; and the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s</span> treat K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as their beloved son or lover. Mother Ya&#347;od&#257; accepts Him as her son and sometimes binds Him to a grinding mortar. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s cowherd boy friends think He is an ordinary boy and get up on His shoulders. In Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana no one has any desire other than to love K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.&rsquo; &rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="72375"></A><div id="72375"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The conclusion is that one cannot associate with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a unless he has fully received the favor of the inhabitants of Vrajabh&#363;mi. Therefore if one wants to be delivered by K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a directly, he must take to the service of the residents of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, who are unalloyed devotees of the Lord.</div>

Still, due to false prestige, a class of women wants to remain independent. What to speak of women, all living entities are <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> (female) and therefore dependent on the Supreme Lord, as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a Himself explains in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">apareyam itas tv any&#257;&#7745; prak&#7771;ti&#7745; viddhi me par&#257;m</span>). The living entity is never independent. Under all circumstances, he is dependent on the mercy of the Lord. The Lord creates the social divisions of human society&mdash;<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as, k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span>&mdash;and ordains that they follow rules and regulations suited to their particular position. In this way, all members of society remain always under the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s control. Still, some people foolishly deny the existence of God.</div>

<div class="Purport">Self-realization means to understand one&rsquo;s subordinate position in relation to the Lord. When one is thus enlightened, he surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is liberated from the clutches of the material energy. In other words, unless one surrenders to the lotus feet of the Lord, the material energy in its many varieties will continue to control him. No one in the material world can deny that he is under control. The Supreme Lord, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, who is beyond this material existence, controls everyone. The following Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> confirms this point: <span class="Italic">eko ha vai n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a &#257;s&#299;t.</span> Foolish persons think N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a to be on the platform of ordinary material existence. Because they do not realize the natural constitutional position of the living entity, they concoct names like <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, sv&#257;mi-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">mithy&#257;-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a.</span> However, N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a is actually the supreme controller of everyone. This understanding is self-realization.</div>

<div class="First">It is fashionable for materialistic persons to compete with the power of God. When so-called scientists try to manufacture living entities in their laboratories, their only purpose is to defy the talent and ability of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called illusion. It exists even in the higher planetary systems, where great demigods like Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva and others reside. In this world everyone is puffed up with false prestige despite the failure of all his endeavors. When so-called philanthropists, who supposedly want to help the poor, are approached by members of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement, they say, &ldquo;You are simply wasting your time, while I am feeding vast masses of starving people.&rdquo; Unfortunately, their meager efforts, either singly or together, do not solve anyone&rsquo;s problems.</div>

They say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage service to Lord N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a. It is better to serve the starving people of the world.&rdquo; Unfortunately such materialists, either singly or combined in the form of the United Nations, cannot fulfill their plans. The truth is that the many millions of human beings, animals, birds and trees&mdash;indeed, all living entities&mdash;are maintained solely by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Eko bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; yo vidadh&#257;ti k&#257;m&#257;n:</span> one person, the Supreme Lord, is supplying the necessities of life for all other living entities.

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">priyatama</span> (dearmost) is very significant in this verse. Each devotee regards a particular form of the Lord as most dear. Because of an atheistic mentality, some people think that the tortoise, boar and fish incarnations of the Lord are not very beautiful. They do not know that any form of the Lord is always the fully opulent Personality of Godhead. Since one of His opulences is infinite beauty, all the Lord&rsquo;s incarnations are very beautiful and are appreciated as such by devotees. Nondevotees, however, think that Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s incarnations are ordinary material creatures, and therefore they distinguish between the beautiful and the not beautiful. A certain form of the Lord is worshiped by a particular devotee because he loves to see that form of the Lord.

Since the countless varieties of forms within this cosmic manifestation are simply a display of Your external energy, this vir&#257;&#7789;-r&#363;pa [universal body] is not Your real form. Except for a devotee in transcendental consciousness, no one can perceive Your actual form. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</div>

<div class="First">M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers think the universal form of the Lord to be real and His personal form illusory. We can understand their mistake by a simple example. A fire consists of three elements: heat and light, which are the energy of the fire, and the fire itself. Anyone can understand that the original fire is the reality and that the heat and light are simply the fire&rsquo;s energy. Heat and light are the formless energies of fire, and in that sense they are unreal. Only the fire has form, and therefore it is the real form of the heat and light. As K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a states in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/4?d=1">9.4</a>), <span class="Italic">may&#257; tatam ida&#7745; sarva&#7745; jagad avyakta-m&#363;rtin&#257;:</span> &ldquo;By Me, in My unmanifested form. this entire universe is pervaded.&rdquo; Thus the impersonal conception of the Lord is like the expansion of heat and light from a fire. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the Lord also says, <span class="Italic">mat-sth&#257;ni sarva-bh&#363;t&#257;ni na c&#257;ha&#7745; te&#7779;v avasthita&#7717;:</span> the entire material creation is resting on K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s energy, either material, spiritual or marginal, but because His form is absent from the expansion of His energy, He is not personally present. This inconceivable expansion of the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s energy is called <span class="Italic">acintya-&#347;akti.</span> Therefore no one can understand the real form of the Lord without becoming His devotee.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear Lord, You manifest Your different energies in countless forms: as living entities born from wombs, from eggs and from perspiration; as plants and trees that grow out of the earth; as all living entities, both moving and standing, including the demigods, the learned sages and the pit&#257;s; as outer space, as the higher planetary system containing the heavenly planets, and as the planet earth with its hills, rivers, seas, oceans and islands. Indeed, all the stars and planets are simply manifestations of Your different energies, but originally You are one without a second. Therefore there is nothing beyond You. This entire cosmic manifestation is therefore not false but is simply a temporary manifestation of Your inconceivable energy.</div>

<div class="First">This verse completely rejects the theory of <span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;,</span> which states that spirit, or Brahman, is real, whereas the manifested material world, with its great variety of things, is false. Nothing is false. One thing may be permanent and another temporary, but both the permanent and the temporary are facts. For example, if someone becomes angry for a certain period, no one can say that his anger is false. It is simply temporary. Everything we experience in our daily lives is of this same character; it is temporary but real.</div>
<A NAME="72495"></A><div id="72495"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The different kinds of living entities coming from various sources are very clearly described in this verse. Some are born from a womb and some (like certain insects) from human perspiration. Others hatch from eggs, and still others sprout from the earth. A living entity takes birth under different circumstances according to his past activities (<span class="Italic">karma</span>). Although the body of the living entity is material, it is never false. No one will accept the argument that since a person&rsquo;s material body is false, murder has no repercussions. Our temporary bodies are given to us according to our <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and we must remain in our given bodies to enjoy the pains and pleasures of life. Our bodies cannot be called false; they are only temporary. In other words, the energy of the Supreme Lord is as permanent as the Lord Himself, although His energy is sometimes manifest and sometimes not. As summarized in the <span class="Italic">Vedas, sarva&#7745; khalv ida&#7745; brahma:</span> &ldquo;Everything is Brahman.&rdquo;</div>
