<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s attainment of the body of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is described. In this body he remained like one dull, deaf and dumb, so much so that when he was brought before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; to be killed as a sacrifice, he never protested but remained silent. After having given up the body of a deer, he took birth in the womb of the youngest wife of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In this life he could also remember the activities of his past life, and in order to avoid the influence of society, he remained like a deaf and dumb person. He was very careful not to fall down again. He did not mix with anyone who was not a devotee. This process should be adopted by every devotee. As advised by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: <span class="Italic">asat-sa&#7749;ga-ty&#257;ga&mdash;ei vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-&#257;c&#257;ra.</span> One should strictly avoid the company of nondevotees, even though they may be family members. When Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was in the body of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> the people in the neighborhood thought of him as a crazy, dull fellow, but within he was always chanting and remembering V&#257;sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although his father wanted to give him an education and purify him as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by offering him the sacred thread, he remained in such a way that his father and mother could understand that he was crazy and not interested in the reformatory method. Nonetheless, he remained fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, even without undergoing such official ceremonies. Due to his silence, some people who were no better than animals began to tease him in many ways, but he tolerated this. After the death of his father and mother, his stepmother and stepbrothers began to treat him very poorly. They would give him the most condemned food, but still he did not mind; he remained completely absorbed in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. He was ordered by his stepbrothers and mother to guard a paddy field one night, and at that time the leader of a dacoit party took him away and tried to kill him by offering him as a sacrifice before Bhadra K&#257;l&#299;. When the dacoits brought Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; and raised a chopper to kill him, the goddess K&#257;l&#299; became immediately alarmed due to the mistreatment of a devotee. She came out of the deity and, taking the chopper in her own hands, killed all the dacoits there. Thus a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can remain silent despite the mistreatment of nondevotees. Rogues and dacoits who misbehave toward a devotee are punished at last by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

There was a br&#257;hma&#7751;a who belonged to the dynasty of A&#7749;gir&#257;. He was fully qualified with brahminical qualifications. He could control his mind and senses, and he had studied the Vedic literatures and other subsidiary literatures. He was expert in giving charity, and he was always satisfied, tolerant, very gentle, learned and nonenvious. He was self-realized and engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He remained always in a trance. He had nine equally qualified sons by his first wife, and by his second wife he begot twins&mdash;a brother and a sister, of which the male child was said to be the topmost devotee and foremost of saintly kings&mdash;Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. This, then, is the story of the birth he took after giving up the body of a deer.</div>

However, due to his strong position as a devotee, he was gifted with the remembrance of his past life. Being repentant, he remained in a solitary forest and always thought of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a.

<div class="Translation">Due to his being especially gifted with the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could remember the incidents of his past life. Although he received the body of a br&#257;hma&#7751;a, he was still very much afraid of his relatives and friends who were not devotees. He was always very cautious of such association because he feared that he would again fall down. Consequently he manifested himself before the public eye as a madman&mdash;dull, blind and deaf&mdash;so that others would not try to talk to him. In this way he saved himself from bad association. Within he was always thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord and chanting the Lord&rsquo;s glories, which save one from the bondage of fruitive action. In this way he saved himself from the onslaught of nondevotee associates.</div>

<div class="Translation">The br&#257;hma&#7751;a father&rsquo;s mind was always filled with affection for his son, Ja&#7693;a Bharata [Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja].

Because Ja&#7693;a Bharata was unfit to enter the g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama, he simply executed the purificatory process up to the end of the brahmacarya-&#257;&#347;rama. Although Ja&#7693;a Bharata was unwilling to accept his father&rsquo;s instructions, the br&#257;hma&#7751;a nonetheless instructed him in how to keep clean and how to wash, thinking that the son should be taught by the father.</div>

<div class="Translation">Degraded men are actually no better than animals. The only difference is that animals have four legs and such men have only two. These two-legged, animalistic men used to call Ja&#7693;a Bharata mad, dull, deaf and dumb. They mistreated him, and Ja&#7693;a Bharata behaved for them like a madman who was deaf, blind or dull. He did not protest or try to convince them that he was not so. If others wanted him to do something, he acted according to their desires. Whatever food he could acquire by begging or by wages, and whatever came of its own accord&mdash;be it a small quantity, palatable, stale or tasteless&mdash;he would accept and eat. He never ate anything for sense gratification because he was already liberated from the bodily conception, which induces one to accept palatable or unpalatable food. He was full in the transcendental consciousness of devotional service, and therefore he was unaffected by the dualities arising from the bodily conception. Actually his body was as strong as a bull&rsquo;s, and his limbs were very muscular. He didn&rsquo;t care for winter or summer, wind or rain, and he never covered his body at any time. He lay on the ground, and never smeared oil on his body or took a bath. Because his body was dirty, his spiritual effulgence and knowledge were covered, just as the splendor of a valuable gem is covered by dirt. He only wore a dirty loincloth and his sacred thread, which was blackish. Understanding that he was born in a br&#257;hma&#7751;a family, people would call him a brahma-bandhu and other names. Being thus insulted and neglected by materialistic people, he wandered here and there.</div>

<div class="Translation">Ja&#7693;a Bharata used to work only for food. His stepbrothers took advantage of this and engaged him in agricultural field work in exchange for some food, but actually he did not know how to work very well in the field. He did not know where to spread dirt or where to make the ground level or uneven. His brothers used to give him broken rice, oil cakes, the chaff of rice, worm-eaten grains and burned grains that had stuck to the pot, but he gladly accepted all this as if it were nectar. He did not hold any grudges and ate all this very gladly.</div>

<div class="Translation">The followers and servants of the dacoit chief considered Ja&#7693;a Bharata to possess qualities quite suitable for a man-animal, and they decided that he was a perfect choice for sacrifice. Their faces bright with happiness, they bound him with ropes and brought him to the temple of the goddess K&#257;l&#299;.</div>

<div class="First">In some parts of India, animalistic men are still sacrificed before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;. However, such a sacrifice is only performed by <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and dacoits. Their business is to plunder the wealthy, and to become successful they offer an animalistic man before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;. It should be noted that they never sacrifice an intelligent man before the goddess. In the body of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja appeared deaf and dumb, yet he was the most intelligent man in the world. Nonetheless, being completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he remained in that condition and did not protest being brought before the deity for slaughter. As we have learned from the previous verses, he was very strong and could have very easily avoided being bound with ropes, but he did not do anything. He simply depended on the Supreme Personality of Godhead for his protection. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura describes surrender unto the Supreme Lord in this way:</div>

<div class="Translation">After this, all the thieves, according to their imaginative ritual for killing animalistic men, bathed Ja&#7693;a Bharata, dressed him in new clothes, decorated him with ornaments befitting an animal, smeared his body with scented oils and decorated him with tilaka, sandalwood pulp and garlands. They fed him sumptuously and then brought him before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;, offering her incense, lamps, garlands, parched grain, newly grown twigs, sprouts, fruits and flowers. In this way they worshiped the deity before killing the man-animal, and they vibrated songs and prayers and played drums and bugles. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was then made to sit down before the deity.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse the word <span class="Italic">sva-vidhin&#257;</span> (according to their own ritualistic principles) is very significant. According to the Vedic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> everything must be done according to regulative principles, but here it is stated that the thieves and rogues devised their own process for killing an animalistic man. The tamasic <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> give instructions for the sacrifice of an animal like a goat or buffalo before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;, but there is no mention of killing a man, however dull he may be. This process was manufactured by the dacoits themselves; therefore the word <span class="Italic">sva-vidhin&#257;</span> is used. Even at this time there are many sacrifices being conducted without reference to the Vedic scriptures. For instance, in Calcutta recently a slaughterhouse was being advertised as a temple of the goddess K&#257;l&#299;. Meat-eaters foolishly purchase meat from such shops, thinking it different from ordinary meat and taking it to be the <span class="Italic">pras&#257;da</span> of goddess K&#257;l&#299;. The sacrifice of a goat or a similar animal before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; is mentioned in <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> just to keep people from eating slaughterhouse meat and becoming responsible for the killing of animals. The conditioned soul has a natural tendency toward sex and meat-eating; consequently the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> grant them some concessions. Actually the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> aim at putting an end to these abominable activities, but they impart some regulative principles so that gradually meat-eaters and sex hunters will be rectified.</div>

<div class="Translation">All the rogues and thieves who had made arrangements for the worship of goddess K&#257;l&#299; were low minded and bound to the modes of passion and ignorance. They were overpowered by the desire to become very rich; therefore they had the audacity to disobey the injunctions of the Vedas, so much so that they were prepared to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata, a self-realized soul born in a br&#257;hma&#7751;a family. Due to their envy, these dacoits brought him before the goddess K&#257;l&#299; for sacrifice. Such people are always addicted to envious activities, and therefore they dared to try to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was the best friend of all living entities. He was no one&rsquo;s enemy, and he was always absorbed in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was born of a good br&#257;hma&#7751;a father, and killing him was forbidden, even though he might have been an enemy or aggressive person. In any case, there was no reason to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata, and the goddess K&#257;l&#299; could not bear this. She could immediately understand that these sinful dacoits were about to kill a great devotee of the Lord. Suddenly the deity&rsquo;s body burst asunder, and the goddess K&#257;l&#299; personally emerged from it in a body burning with an intense and intolerable effulgence.</div>

<div class="First">According to the Vedic injunctions, only an aggressor can be killed. If a person comes with an intent to kill, one can immediately take action and kill in self-defense. It is also stated that one can be killed if he comes to set fire to the home or to pollute or kidnap one&rsquo;s wife. Lord R&#257;macandra killed the entire family of R&#257;va&#7751;a because R&#257;va&#7751;a kidnapped His wife, S&#299;t&#257;dev&#299;. However, killing is not sanctioned in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras</span> for other purposes. The killing of animals in sacrifice to the demigods, who are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is sanctioned for those who eat meat. This is a kind of restriction for meat-eating. In other words, the slaughter of animals is also restricted by certain rules and regulations in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Considering these points, there was no reason to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata, who was born in a respectable, highly exalted <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family. He was a God-realized soul and a well-wisher to all living entities. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> did not at all sanction the killing of Ja&#7693;a Bharata by rogues and thieves. Consequently the goddess Bhadra K&#257;l&#299; emerged from the deity to give protection to the Lord&rsquo;s devotee. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura explains that due to the Brahman effulgence of such a devotee as Ja&#7693;a Bharata, the deity was fractured. Only thieves and rogues in the modes of passion and ignorance and maddened by material opulence offer a man in sacrifice before the goddess K&#257;l&#299;. This is not sanctioned by the Vedic instructions. Presently there are many hundreds and thousands of slaughterhouses throughout the world that are maintained by a puffed-up population mad for material opulence. Such activities are never supported by the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> school.</div>

<div class="Translation">Intolerant of the offenses committed, the infuriated goddess K&#257;l&#299; flashed her eyes and displayed her fierce, curved teeth. Her reddish eyes glowed, and she displayed her fearsome features. She assumed a frightening body, as if she were prepared to destroy the entire creation. Leaping violently from the altar, she immediately decapitated all the rogues and thieves with the very sword with which they had intended to kill Ja&#7693;a Bharata. She then began to drink the hot blood that flowed from the necks of the beheaded rogues and thieves, as if this blood were liquor. Indeed, she drank this intoxicant with her associates, who were witches and female demons. Becoming intoxicated with this blood, they all began to sing very loudly and dance as though prepared to annihilate the entire universe. At the same time, they began to play with the heads of the rogues and thieves, tossing them about as if they were balls.</div>

<div class="First">It is evident from this verse that the devotees of goddess K&#257;l&#299; are not at all favored by her. It is goddess K&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s work to kill and punish the demons. Goddess K&#257;l&#299; (Durg&#257;) engages in decapitating many demons, dacoits and other unwanted elements in society. Neglecting K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, foolish people try to satisfy the goddess by offering her many abominable things, but ultimately when there is a little discrepancy in this worship, the goddess punishes the worshiper by taking his life. Demoniac people worship goddess K&#257;l&#299; to obtain some material benefit, but they are not excused of the sins performed in the name of worship. To sacrifice a man or animal before the deity is specifically forbidden.</div>

The devotees always take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord. Therefore at all times, even if threatened by decapitation, they remain unagitated. For them, this is not at all wonderful.</div>

<div class="First">These are some of the great qualities of a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. First, a devotee is firmly convinced of his spiritual identity. He never identifies with the body; he is firmly convinced that the spirit soul is different from the body. Consequently he fears nothing. Even though his life may be threatened, he is not at all afraid. He does not even treat an enemy like an enemy. Such are the qualifications of devotees. Devotees are always fully dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Lord is always eager to give them all protection in all circumstances.</div>
