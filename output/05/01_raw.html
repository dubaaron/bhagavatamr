<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><JD:"Destination-1317">This chapter describes how King Priyavrata enjoyed royal opulence and majesty and then returned to full knowledge. King Priyavrata was detached from worldly opulence, and then he became attached to his kingdom, but finally he again became detached from material enjoyment and thus achieved liberation. When King Par&#299;k&#7779;it heard about this, he was struck with wonder, but he was somewhat bewildered as to how a devotee with no attachment for material enjoyment could later become attached to it. Thus in astonishment he questioned &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; about this.</div>
</div><A NAME="66572"></A><div id="66572"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>In response to the King&rsquo;s inquiries, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said that devotional service, being transcendental, cannot be deviated by any material influences. Priyavrata had received transcendental knowledge from the instructions of N&#257;rada, and therefore he did not want to enter a materialistic life of enjoyment in a kingdom. He accepted the kingdom, however, at the request of such superior demigods as Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord Indra, the King of heaven.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>Everything is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, and everyone must work accordingly. Just as a bull is controlled by a rope tied to its nose, so all conditioned souls are forced to work under the spells of the modes of nature. A civilized man, therefore, works according to the institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama.</span> Even in materialistic life, however, no one is free to act. Everyone is compelled to accept a certain type of body offered by the Supreme Lord and thus be allotted different grades of happiness and distress. Therefore even if one artificially leaves home and goes to the forest, he again becomes attached to materialistic life. Family life is compared to a fortress for practicing sense control. When the senses are controlled. one may live either at home or in the forest; there is no difference.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, following the instruction of Lord Brahm&#257;. accepted the royal throne, his father, Manu, left home for the forest. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata then married Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;, the daughter of Vi&#347;vakarm&#257;. In the womb of Barhi&#7779;mat&#299; he begot ten sons, named &#256;gn&#299;dhra, Idhmajihva, Yajï¿½ab&#257;hu, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra, Hira&#7751;yaret&#257;, Gh&#7771;tap&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;ha, Savana, Medh&#257;tithi, V&#299;tihotra and Kavi. He also begot one daughter, whose name was &#362;rjasvat&#299;. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata lived with his wife and family for many thousands of years. The impressions from the rims of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata&rsquo;s chariot wheels created seven oceans and seven islands. Of the ten sons of Priyavrata, three sons named Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana accepted <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the fourth order of life, and the remaining seven sons became the rulers of the seven islands. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata also had a second wife, in whom he begot three sons named Uttama, Raivata and T&#257;masa. All of them were elevated to the post of Manu. &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; thus described how Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata achieved liberation.</div>

<div class="Translation">King Par&#299;k&#7779;it inquired from &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;: O great sage, why did King Priyavrata, who was a great, self-realized devotee of the Lord, remain in household life, which is the root cause of the bondage of karma [fruitive activities] and which defeats the mission of human life?</div>

<div class="First">In the Fourth Canto, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; explains that N&#257;rada Muni perfectly instructed King Priyavrata about the mission of human life. The mission of human life is to realize one&rsquo;s self and then gradually to go back home, back to Godhead. Since N&#257;rada Muni instructed the King fully on this subject, why did he again enter household life, which is the main cause of material bondage? Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was greatly astonished that King Priyavrata remained in household life, especially since he was not only a self-realized soul but also a first-class devotee of the Lord. A devotee actually has no attraction for household life, but surprisingly, King Priyavrata enjoyed household life very much. One may argue, &ldquo;Why is it wrong to enjoy household life?&rdquo; The reply is that in household life one becomes bound by the results of fruitive activities. The essence of household life is sense enjoyment, and as long as one engrosses his mind in working hard for sense enjoyment, one becomes bound by the reactions of fruitive activities. This ignorance of self-realization is the greatest defeat in human life. The human form of life is especially meant for getting out of the bondage of fruitive activities, but as long as one is forgetful of his life&rsquo;s mission and acts like an ordinary animal&mdash;eating, sleeping, mating and defending&mdash;he must continue his conditioned life of material existence. Such a life is called <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa-vism&#7771;ti,</span> forgetfulness of one&rsquo;s real constitutional position. Therefore in Vedic civilization one is trained in the very beginning of life as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> A <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span> must execute austerities and refrain from sex indulgence. Therefore if one is completely trained in the principles of <span class="Italic">brahmacarya,</span> he generally does not enter household life. He is then called a <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;&#7789;hika-brahmac&#257;r&#299;,</span> which indicates total celibacy. King Par&#299;k&#7779;it was thus astonished that the great King Priyavrata, although trained in the principles of <span class="Italic">nai&#7779;&#7789;hika-brahmacarya,</span> entered household life.</div>
<A NAME="66590"></A><div id="66590"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The words <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma&#7717;</span> are very significant in this verse. If one is self-satisfied as is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is called <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma&#7717;.</span> There are different types of satisfaction. <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s</span> are satisfied in their fruitive activities, <span class="Italic">jï¿½&#257;n&#299;s</span> are satisfied to merge into the effulgence of Brahman, and devotees are satisfied to engage in the Lord&rsquo;s service. The Lord is self-satisfied because He is fully opulent, and one who is satisfied by serving Him is called <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata &#257;tm&#257;r&#257;ma&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Manu&#7779;y&#257;&#7751;&#257;&#7745; sahasre&#7779;u: [Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/3?d=1">7.3</a>]</span> out of many thousands of persons, one may endeavor for liberation, and of many thousands of persons attempting to become liberated, one may achieve liberation from the anxieties of material existence and become self-satisfied. Even that satisfaction, however, is not the ultimate satisfaction. The <span class="Italic">jï¿½&#257;n&#299;s</span> and the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> have desires, as do the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> but devotees have no desires. Satisfaction in the service of the Lord is called <span class="Italic">ak&#257;ma,</span> freedom from desire, and this is the ultimate satisfaction. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it inquired, &ldquo;How could one who was fully satisfied on the highest platform be satisfied with family life?&rdquo;</div>
<A NAME="66591"></A><div id="66591"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">par&#257;bhava&#7717;</span> in this verse is also significant. When one is satisfied in family life, he is doomed because he must already have forgotten his relationship with the Lord. Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja describes how the activities of family life implicate one more and more. <span class="Italic">&#256;tma-p&#257;ta&#7745; g&#7771;ham andha-k&#363;pam:</span> household life is like a dark well. If one falls into this well, his spiritual death is assured. How Priyavrata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja remained a liberated <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> even within family life is described in the next verse.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> it is said that by executing devotional service to the Lord, one can understand the transcendental position of the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood by any means except <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> The Lord confirms this in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (11.14.21). <span class="Italic">Bhakty&#257;ham ekay&#257; gr&#257;hya&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;only by executing devotional service can one appreciate Me.&rdquo; Similarly, in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/55?d=1">18.55</a>) Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">bhakty&#257; m&#257;m abhij&#257;n&#257;ti:</span> &ldquo;simply by discharging devotional service, one can understand Me.&rdquo; Thus for a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> to become attached to family affairs is impossible, since a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> and his associates are liberated. Everyone is searching after <span class="Italic">&#257;nanda,</span> or bliss, but in the material world there can never be any bliss. It is only possible in devotional service. Attachment for family affairs and devotional service are incompatible. Therefore Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it was somewhat surprised to hear that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was simultaneously attached to devotional service and to family life.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: What you have said is correct. The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is praised in eloquent, transcendental verses by such exalted personalities as Brahm&#257;, are very pleasing to great devotees and liberated persons. One who is attached to the nectarean honey of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, and whose mind is always absorbed in His glories, may sometimes be checked by some impediment, but he still never gives up the exalted position he has acquired.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; accepted both of the King&rsquo;s propositions&mdash;that a person who is advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness cannot embrace materialistic life again and that one who has embraced materialistic life cannot take up K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness at any stage of his existence. Although accepting both these statements, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; qualified them by saying that a person who has once absorbed his mind in the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may sometimes be influenced by impediments, but he still does not give up his exalted devotional position.</div>
<A NAME="66648"></A><div id="66648"> </div>
<div class="Purport">According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura, there are two kinds of impediments to devotional service. The first is an offense at the lotus feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. This is called <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha.</span> &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu warned His devotees not to commit <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha,</span> which He described as the mad elephant offense. When a mad elephant enters a beautiful garden, it destroys everything, leaving a barren field. Similarly, the power of <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha</span> is so great that even an advanced devotee becomes almost devoid of his spiritual assets if he commits it. Since K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is eternal, it cannot be destroyed altogether, but advancement may be checked for the time being. Thus <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha</span> is one kind of impediment to devotional service. Sometimes, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee desires to impede one&rsquo;s devotional service. For example, Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu and Hira&#7751;y&#257;k&#7779;a were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha, but by the desire of the Lord, they became His enemies for three lives. Thus the desire of the Lord is another kind of impediment. But in both cases, the pure devotee, once advanced in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, cannot be lost. Following the orders of his superiors (Sv&#257;yambhuva and Lord Brahm&#257;), Priyavrata accepted family life, but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances. Because the material world is full of obstructions to advancement in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, there may appear to be many impediments, yet K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declares in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/31?d=1">9.31</a>), <span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati:</span> once one has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost.</div>

<div class="Purport">In this verse, the word <span class="Italic">&#347;ivatam&#257;m</span> is very significant. <span class="Italic">&#346;ivatam&#257;m</span> means &ldquo;the most auspicious.&rdquo; The devotional path is so auspicious that a devotee cannot be lost under any circumstances. This is described in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> by the Lord Himself. <span class="Italic">p&#257;rtha naiveha n&#257;mutra vin&#257;&#347;as tasya vidyate:</span> &ldquo;My dear Arjuna, for a devotee there is no question of being lost, either in this life or in the next.&rdquo; (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/6/40?d=1">6.40</a>) In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/6/43?d=1">6.43</a>) the Lord clearly explains how this is so.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">By the order of the Lord, a perfect devotee sometimes comes to this material world like an ordinary human being. Because of his previous practice, such a perfect devotee naturally becomes attached to devotional service, apparently without cause. Despite all kinds of impediments due to surrounding circumstances, he automatically perseveres in devotional service and gradually advances until he once again becomes perfect. Bilvama&#7749;gala &#7788;h&#257;kura had been an advanced devotee in his previous life, but in his next life he became greatly fallen and was attached to a prostitute. Suddenly, however, his entire behavior was changed by the words of the very prostitute who had so much attracted him, and he became a great devotee. In the lives of exalted devotees, there are many such instances, proving that once one has taken to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost (<span class="Italic">kaunteya pratij&#257;n&#299;hi na me bhakta&#7717; pra&#7751;a&#347;yati</span>).</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: My dear King, Prince Priyavrata was a great devotee because he sought the lotus feet of N&#257;rada, his spiritual master, and thus achieved the highest perfection in transcendental knowledge. With advanced knowledge, he always engaged in discussing spiritual subjects and did not divert his attention to anything else. The Prince&rsquo;s father then asked him to take charge of ruling the world. He tried to convince Priyavrata that this was his duty as indicated in the revealed scriptures. Prince Priyavrata, however, was continuously practicing bhakti-yoga by constantly remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thus engaging all his senses in the service of the Lord. Therefore, although the order of his father could not be rejected, the Prince did not welcome it. Thus he very conscientiously raised the question of whether he might be diverted from devotional service by accepting the responsibility of ruling over the world.</div>

The word <span class="Italic">sa-tattva&#7717;</span> means that Priyavrata knew all the facts about the spirit soul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the relationship between the spirit soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he also knew all about this material world and the relationship of the spirit soul and the Supreme Lord within the material world. Thus the Prince decided to engage himself only in rendering service to the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="66669"></A><div id="66669"> </div>
<div class="Purport">When Priyavrata&rsquo;s father, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, requested him to accept the responsibility of ruling over the world, he did not welcome the suggestion. This is the symptom of a great, liberated devotee. Even though engaged in worldly affairs, he does not take pleasure in them, but remains always absorbed in the Lord&rsquo;s service. While thus serving the Lord, he deals externally with worldly affairs without being affected. For example, although he has no attraction for his children, he cares for them and educates them to become devotees. Similarly, he speaks to his wife with affectionate words, but he is not attached to her. By rendering devotional service, a devotee acquires all the good qualities of the Supreme Lord. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a had sixteen thousand wives, all of them very beautiful, and although He dealt with each of them as a beloved husband, He was not attracted or attached to any of them. In the same way, although a devotee may enter family life and act very affectionately toward his wife and children, he is never attached to these activities.</div>

<div class="First">Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Supreme Self (<span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;</span>), is the source of everything, as explained in the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra:</span> <span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya yata&#7717;</I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1">1.1.1</a></I>]</I>.</span> Because Brahm&#257; was born directly from Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, he is called <span class="Italic">&#257;tma-yoni.</span> He is also called <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n,</span> although generally <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Vi&#7779;&#7751;u or Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a). Sometimes great personalities&mdash;such as demigods like Lord Brahm&#257;, N&#257;rada or Lord &#346;iva&mdash;are also addressed as <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> because they carry out the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Brahm&#257; is called <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> because he is the secondary creator of this universe. He is always thinking of how to improve the situation of the conditioned souls who have come to the material world to enjoy material activities. For this reason, he disseminates the Vedic knowledge throughout the universe for everyone&rsquo;s guidance.</div>
<A NAME="66690"></A><div id="66690"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Vedic knowledge is divided into two parts: <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga</span> and <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga.</span> <span class="Italic">Niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga</span> is the path of negating sense enjoyment, and <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga</span> is the path by which the living entities are given a chance to enjoy and at the same time are directed in such a way that they can go back home, back to Godhead. Because ruling over this universe is a great responsibility, Brahm&#257; must force many Manus in different ages to take charge of universal affairs. Under each Manu there are different kings who also execute the purpose of Lord Brahm&#257;. It is understood from previous explanations that the father of Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, King Utt&#257;nap&#257;da, ruled over the universe because his elder brother, Priyavrata, practiced austerity from the very beginning of his life. Thus up to the point of the Pracet&#257;s, the kings of the universe were all descendants of Utt&#257;nap&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Since there were no suitable kings after the Pracet&#257;s, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu went to the Gandham&#257;dana Hill to bring back his eldest son, Priyavrata, who was meditating there. Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu requested Priyavrata to rule over the universe. When he refused, Lord Brahm&#257; descended from the supreme planetary system, known as Satyaloka, to request Priyavrata to accept the order. Lord Brahm&#257; did not come alone. He came with other great sages like Mar&#299;ci, &#256;treya and Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha. To convince Priyavrata that it was necessary for him to follow the Vedic injunctions and accept the responsibility of ruling over the world, Lord Brahm&#257; also brought with him the personified <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> his constant associates.</div>

Another significant point is that there is a planet covered mostly by great mountains, one of which is Gandham&#257;dana Hill.

Similarly, the residents of Gandharvaloka are expert in musical science, and those on S&#257;dhyaloka are all great saints. The interplanetary system undoubtedly exists, and residents of different planets may go from one to another. On this earth, however, we have not invented any machine that can go directly from one planet to another, although an unsuccessful attempt has been made to go directly to the moon.</div>

<div class="First">That Lord Brahm&#257; descended from Satyaloka to see Priyavrata indicates that the matter was very serious.

Therefore unless Lord Brahm&#257; personally went to Gandham&#257;dana Hill to request Priyavrata, Lord Brahm&#257; knew that prince Priyavrata would not accept his father&rsquo;s order. Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s purpose was to break Priyavrata&rsquo;s determination. Therefore Brahm&#257; first looked upon Priyavrata with compassion. His smile and compassionate features also indicated that although Brahm&#257; would request Priyavrata to accept household life, Priyavrata would not be out of touch with devotional service. By the blessings of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, everything is possible. This is described in <span class="Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> as <span class="Italic">k&#7771;p&#257;-siddhi,</span> or perfection attained simply by the blessings of a superior person.

<div class="Translation">Lord Brahm&#257;, the supreme person within this universe, said: My dear Priyavrata, kindly hear attentively what I shall say to you. Do not be jealous of the Supreme Lord, who is beyond our experimental measurements.

<div class="First">Of the twelve great authorities in devotional service, four&mdash;Lord Brahm&#257; himself, his son N&#257;rada, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu and Lord &#346;iva&mdash;were present before Priyavrata. They were accompanied by many other authoritative sages. Brahm&#257; first wanted to impress upon Priyavrata that although these great personalities are all authorities, they cannot possibly disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described in this verse as <span class="Italic">deva,</span> which means &ldquo;always glorious.&rdquo; The power, glory and potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never be diminished. In the <span class="Italic">&#298;&#347;opani&#7779;ad,</span> the Lord is described as <span class="Italic">ap&#257;pa-viddha,</span> which indicates that He is never affected by anything materially considered sinful. Similarly, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead as being so powerful that nothing we might consider abominable can affect Him. An example sometimes given to explain the position of the Supreme Lord is that of the sun, which evaporates urine from the earth but is never affected by contamination. The Supreme Lord can never be accused of doing anything wrong.</div>

<div class="Purport">When Lord Brahm&#257; went to induce Priyavrata to accept the responsibility for ruling the universe, he did not go whimsically; he was following the dictations of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, Brahm&#257; and other genuine authorities never do anything without His permission. The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart. In the beginning of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">tene brahma h&#7771;d&#257; ya &#257;di-kavaye:</span> the Lord dictated Vedic knowledge to Brahm&#257; through his heart. The more a living entity is purified by devotional service, the more he comes in direct contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span></div>

All these authorities are certainly very powerful, but they do not have the power to disobey the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Brahm&#257; had come to Priyavrata in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Lord, he first wanted to dispel any suspicions that he might be acting as Priyavrata&rsquo;s enemy. Lord Brahm&#257; was following the orders of the Supreme Lord, and therefore it would be worthwhile for Priyavrata to accept Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s order, as the Lord desired.</div>

<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;ay&#257;</span> (&ldquo;by intelligence&rdquo;) is of special significance. Priyavrata might argue that Lord Brahm&#257; was requesting him to accept family life and the responsibility for ruling a kingdom, although N&#257;rada Muni had advised him not to enter household life and be entangled in material affairs. Whom to accept would be a puzzle for Priyavrata because both Lord Brahm&#257; and N&#257;rada Muni are authorities. Under the circumstances, the use of the word <span class="Italic">man&#299;&#7779;ay&#257;</span> is very appropriate, for it indicates that since both N&#257;rada Muni and Lord Brahm&#257; are authorized to give instruction, Priyavrata should neglect neither of them but should use his intelligence to follow the advice of both. To solve such dilemmas, &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has given a very clear conception of intelligence. He says:</div>

Becoming a family man or king in the material world is not harmful if one accepts everything for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service. That necessitates clear intelligence. M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers say, <span class="Italic">brahma satya&#7745; jagan mithy&#257;:</span> this material world is false, and only the Absolute Truth is real.

Thus they say that the four divisions of the social order&mdash;<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span>&mdash;should be arranged according to the <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">karma</span> of this life. This version is confirmed in <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by N&#257;rada Muni. While instructing Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhi&#7779;&#7789;hira about the symptoms of <span class="Italic">gu&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">karma,</span> N&#257;rada Muni said that these symptoms must govern the division of society. In other words, if a person born in the family of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> has the symptoms of a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> he should be designated as a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra.</span> Similarly, if a <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span> has brahminical qualities, he should be designated a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>

Therefore instead of worshiping Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. people have been educated to worship matter. According to the direction of modern society, men think they can advance in civilization by manipulating matter to build skyscrapers, big roads, automobiles and so on. Such a civilization must certainly be called materialistic because its people do not know the goal of life. The goal of life is to reach Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. but instead of reaching Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, people are bewildered by the external manifestation of the material energy.

<div class="Translation">My dear Priyavrata, according to our association with different modes of material nature, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives us our specific bodies and the happiness and distress we achieve.

<div class="First">By material means, one cannot avoid the happiness and distress unique to his particular body. There are 8,400,000 bodily forms, each destined to enjoy and suffer a certain amount of happiness and distress. This we cannot change, for the happiness and distress are ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in accordance with whose decision we have received our bodies. Since we cannot avoid the plan of the Supreme Godhead, we must agree to be directed by Him, just as a blind man is led by a person who has eyes. Under any circumstances, if we remain in the condition allotted to us by the Supreme Lord and follow His instructions, we will become perfect. The main purpose of life is to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is such instructions that constitute one&rsquo;s religion or occupational duty.</div>

<div class="Purport">The previous verse has given the analogy of bulls moving under the direction of the driver of a bullock cart. The bulls, being completely surrendered to the driver, remain wherever he wants to place them and eat whatever he wants them to eat. Similarly, being completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we should not aspire for happiness, or regret distress; we must be satisfied with the position allotted to us by the Lord. We should follow the path of devotional service and not be dissatisfied with the happiness and distress He has given. People in the material modes of passion and ignorance generally cannot understand the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with its 8,400,000 forms of life, but the human form affords one the special privilege to understand this plan, engage in devotional service and elevate oneself to the highest position of perfection by following the Lord&rsquo;s instructions. The entire world is working under the influence of the modes of material nature, especially ignorance and passion, but if people engage in hearing and chanting about the glories of the Supreme Lord, their lives can be successful, and they can be elevated to the highest perfection. In the <span class="Italic">B&#7771;han-n&#257;rad&#299;ya Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> therefore, it is said:</div>

Thus all impediments to his progress will be cut to pieces. In conclusion, therefore, we must be satisfied in whatever position we have been put into by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we should try to engage ourselves in His devotional service. Then our lives will be successful.</div>

<div class="First">The difference between a liberated and conditioned soul is that the conditioned soul is under the concept of bodily life, whereas a liberated person knows that he is not the body but a spirit, different from the body. Priyavrata might have thought that although a conditioned soul is forced to act according to the laws of nature, why should he, who was far advanced in spiritual understanding, accept the same kind of bondage and impediments to spiritual advancement? To answer this doubt, Lord Brahm&#257; informed him that even those who are liberated do not resent accepting, in the present body, the results of their past activities. While sleeping, one dreams many unreal things, but when he awakens he disregards them and makes progress in factual life. Similarly, a liberated person&mdash;one who has completely understood that he is not the body but a spirit soul&mdash;disregards past activities performed in ignorance and performs his present activities in such a way that they produce no reactions. This is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/9?d=1">3.9</a>). <span class="Italic">Yajï¿½&#257;rth&#257;t karma&#7751;o &rsquo;nyatra loko &rsquo;ya&#7745; karma-bandhana&#7717;:</span> if one performs activities for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality, the <span class="Italic">yajï¿½a-puru&#7779;a,</span> his work does not produce reactions, whereas <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> who act for themselves, are bound by the reactions of their work.

Here this is also repeated. For one who has not controlled his senses, going to the forest to become a so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;</span> is meaningless. Because his uncontrolled mind and senses are going with him, he cannot achieve anything, even by giving up household life and staying in the forest. Formerly many mercantile men from the up-country of India used to go to Bengal, and thus there is a familiar saying, &ldquo;If you go to Bengal, your fortune will go with you.&rdquo; Our first concern, therefore, should be to control the senses, and since the senses cannot be controlled unless engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, our most important duty is to engage the senses in devotional service. <span class="Italic">H&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#7751;a h&#7771;&#7779;&#299;ke&#347;a-sevana&#7745; bhaktir ucyate:</span></I> [Cc.

<div class="Purport">Herein Lord Brahm&#257; indicates that instead of going to the forest with uncontrolled senses, it is better and more secure to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Even household life can do no harm to a self-controlled person acting in this way; it cannot force him into material bondage. &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has further enunciated this position:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Regardless of one&rsquo;s circumstances, if one fully engages his activities, mind and words in the devotional service of the Lord, he should be understood to be a liberated person.&rdquo; &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktivinoda &#7788;h&#257;kura was a responsible officer and a householder, yet his service to the cause of expanding the mission of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu is unique. &#346;r&#299;la Prabodh&#257;nanda Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">durd&#257;ntendriya-k&#257;la-sarpa-pa&#7789;al&#299; protkh&#257;ta-da&#7745;&#7779;&#7789;r&#257;yate.</span> The sense organs are certainly our greatest enemies, and they are therefore compared to venomous serpents. However, if a venomous serpent is bereft of its poison fangs, it is no longer fearful. Similarly, if the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, there is no need to fear their activities. The devotees in the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement move within this material world, but because their senses are fully engaged in the service of the Lord, they are always aloof from the material world. They are always living in a transcendental position.</div>

When a bumblebee enters the opening of a lotus flower and drinks its honey, it is fully protected by the petals of the lotus. The bee is undisturbed by sunshine and other external influences. Similarly, one who always seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the personality of Godhead is protected from all dangers.

If you carry out His orders, you will never fall, even in the midst of material enjoyment.&rdquo; Material enjoyment achieved by dint of one&rsquo;s fruitive activities differs from material enjoyment given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee sometimes appears to be in a very opulent position, but he accepts that position to follow the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore a devotee is never affected by material influences.

His lifetime is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/8/17?d=1">8.17</a>). <span class="Italic">Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahma&#7751;o vidu&#7717;.</span> The total duration of the four yugas is 4,300,000 years, and when that is multiplied a thousand times, it equals twelve hours in the life of Brahm&#257;. Therefore we cannot factually comprehend even twelve hours of Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s life, to say nothing of the one hundred years that constitute his entire lifetime. How, then, can we understand his abode? The Vedic literatures describe that in Satyaloka there is no birth, death, old age or disease. In other words, since Satyaloka is situated next to Brahmaloka, or the Brahman effulgence, it is almost as good as Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;haloka. Lord Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s abode is practically indescribable from our present status. Therefore it has been described as <span class="Italic">av&#257;&#7749;-manasa-gocara,</span> or beyond the description of our words and the imagination of our minds. The Vedic literatures thus describe the abode of Lord Brahm&#257;: <span class="Italic">yad vai par&#257;rdhya&#7745; tad up&#257;rame&#7779;&#7789;hya&#7745; na yatra &#347;oko na jar&#257; na m&#7771;tyur n&#257;rtir na codvega&#7717;.</span> &ldquo;In Satyaloka, which is situated many millions and billions of years away, there is no lamentation, nor is there old age, death, anxiety or the influence of enemies.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, with the assistance of Lord Brahm&#257;, thus fulfilled his desires. With the permission of the great sage N&#257;rada, he delivered to his son the governmental responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planets of the universe. He thus achieved relief from the most dangerous, poisonous ocean of material desires.</div>

<A NAME="66921"></A><div id="66921"> </div>
<div class="First">Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu was practically hopeless because such a great personality as N&#257;rada was instructing his son Priyavrata not to accept household life. Now he was very pleased that Lord Brahm&#257; had interfered by inducing his son to accept the responsibility for ruling the government of the universe. From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we get information that Vaivasvata Manu was the son of the sun-god and that his son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ik&#7779;v&#257;ku, ruled this planet earth. Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, however, appears to have been in charge of the entire universe, and he entrusted to his son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, the responsibility for maintaining and protecting all the planetary systems. <span class="Italic">Dhar&#257;-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</span> means &ldquo;planet.&rdquo; This earth, for instance, is called <span class="Italic">dhar&#257;-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala.</span> <span class="Italic">Akhila,</span> however, means &ldquo;all&rdquo; or &ldquo;universal.&rdquo; It is therefore difficult to understand where Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was situated, but from this literature his position certainly appears greater than that of Vaivasvata Manu, for he was entrusted with all the planetary systems of the entire universe.</div>
<A NAME="66922"></A><div id="66922"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Another significant statement is that Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu took great satisfaction from abnegating the responsibility for ruling all the planetary systems of the universe. At present, politicians are very eager to take charge of the government, and they engage their men in canvassing from door to door to get votes to win the post of president or a similar exalted office. On the contrary, however, herein we find that King Priyavrata had to be persuaded by Lord Brahm&#257; to accept the post of emperor of the entire universe. Similarly, his father, Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu, felt relieved to entrust the universal government to Priyavrata. Thus it is evident that the kings and executive heads of government in the Vedic age never accepted their positions for sense enjoyment. Such exalted kings, who were known as <span class="Italic">r&#257;jar&#7779;is,</span> ruled only to maintain and protect the kingdom for the welfare of the citizens. The history of Priyavrata and Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu describes how exemplary, responsible monarchs performed the duties of government with disinterest, keeping themselves always aloof from the contamination of material attachment.</div>
<A NAME="66923"></A><div id="66923"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Material affairs have herein been compared to an ocean of poison. They have been described in a similar way by &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura in one of his songs:</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;The only remedy is <span class="Italic">hari-n&#257;ma-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana,</span> the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra,</span> which is imported from the spiritual world, Goloka V&#7771;nd&#257;vana. How unfortunate I am that I have no attraction for this.&rdquo; Manu wanted to seek shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore when his son Priyavrata took charge of his worldly affairs, Manu was very relieved. That is the system of Vedic civilization. At the end of life, one must free himself from worldly affairs and completely engage in the service of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="66928"></A><div id="66928"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The word <span class="Italic">surar&#7779;i-vara-anumatena</span> is also significant. Manu entrusted the government to his son with the permission of the great saint N&#257;rada. This is particularly mentioned because although N&#257;rada wanted Priyavrata to become free from all material affairs, when Priyavrata took charge of the universe by the request of Lord Brahm&#257; and Manu, N&#257;rada was also very pleased.</div>

<div class="First">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata not only carried out the order of Lord Brahm&#257; by accepting the duties of government, but also married Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;, the daughter of Vi&#347;vakarm&#257;, one of the <span class="Italic">praj&#257;patis.</span> Since Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was fully trained in transcendental knowledge, he could have returned home and conducted the business of government as a <span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;.</span> Instead, however, when he returned to household life, he accepted a wife also. The principle is that when one becomes a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha,</span> he must live perfectly in that order, which means he must live peacefully with a wife and children. When Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu&rsquo;s first wife died, His mother requested Him to marry for a second time.

<div class="Purport">Sometimes we are criticized because although I am a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;,</span> I have taken part in the marriage ceremonies of my disciples.

<div class="Translation">Three among these ten&mdash;namely Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana&mdash;lived in complete celibacy.

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">&#363;rdhva-retasa&#7717;</span> in this verse is very significant. <span class="Italic">&#362;rdhva-reta&#7717;</span> refers to one who can control sex life and who instead of wasting semen by discharging it, can use this most important substance accumulated in the body to enrich the brain. One who can completely control sex life is able to work wonderfully with his brain, especially in remembering. Thus students who simply hear Vedic instructions once from their teacher could remember them verbatim without needing to read books, which therefore did not exist in former times.</div>

<div class="Purport">Another significant word is <span class="Italic">arbha-bh&#257;v&#257;t,</span> which means &ldquo;from very childhood.&rdquo; Another meaning is &ldquo;from being very affectionate to children.&rdquo; In other words, <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> life is dedicated for the benefit of others. Just as a father sacrifices many things out of affection for his son, great saintly persons sacrifice all kinds of bodily comforts for the benefit of human society. In this connection there is a verse concerning the six Gosv&#257;m&#299;s:</div>

Thus minimizing their bodily wants as far as possible, they each accepted only a loincloth and a begging bowl. Thus they remained in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana to execute the orders of &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu by compiling and publishing various Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava literatures.</div>

<div class="Translation">Thus situated in the renounced order from the beginning of their lives, all three of them completely controlled the activities of their senses and thus became great saints. They concentrated their minds always upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the resting place of the totality of living entities and who is therefore celebrated as V&#257;sudeva. Lord V&#257;sudeva is the only shelter of those who are actually afraid of material existence. By constantly thinking of His lotus feet, these three sons of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata became advanced in pure devotional service. By the prowess of their devotional service, they could directly perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart as the Supersoul, and realize that there was qualitatively no difference between themselves and Him.</div>

<div class="First">The <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage is the topmost position in renounced life. In <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa,</span> the renounced order, there are four stages&mdash;<span class="Italic">ku&#7789;&#299;caka, bah&#363;daka, parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya</span> and <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa.</span> According to the Vedic system, when one accepts the renounced order, he stays outside his village in a cottage, and his necessities, especially his food, are supplied from home. This is called the <span class="Italic">ku&#7789;&#299;caka</span> stage. When a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> advances further, he no longer accepts anything from home: instead, he collects his necessities, especially his food, from many places. This system is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;dhukar&#299;,</span> which literally means &ldquo;the profession of the bumblebees.&rdquo; As bumblebees collect honey from many flowers, a little from each, so a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> should beg from door to door but not accept very much food from any particular house; he should collect a little bit from every house. This is called the <span class="Italic">bah&#363;daka</span> stage. When a <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> is still more experienced, he travels all over the world to preach the glories of Lord V&#257;sudeva. He is then known as <span class="Italic">parivr&#257;jak&#257;c&#257;rya.</span> The <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;</span> reaches the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage when he finishes his preaching work and sits down in one place, strictly for the sake of advancing in spiritual life. An actual <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> is one who completely controls his senses and engages in the unalloyed service of the Lord. Therefore all three of these sons of Priyavrata, namely Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana, were situated in the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> stage from the very beginning. Their senses could not disturb them, for their senses were completely engaged in serving the Lord. Therefore the three brothers are described in this verse as <span class="Italic">upa&#347;ama-&#347;&#299;l&#257;&#7717;.</span> <span class="Italic">Upa&#347;ama</span> means &ldquo;completely subdued.&rdquo; Because they completely subdued their senses, they are understood to have been great sages and saints.</div>
<A NAME="66991"></A><div id="66991"> </div>
<div class="Purport">After subduing their senses, the three brothers concentrated their minds upon the lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/19?d=1">7.19</a>), <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti.</span> The lotus feet of V&#257;sudeva are everything. Lord V&#257;sudeva is the reservoir of all living entities. When this cosmic manifestation is dissolved, all living entities enter the supreme body of the Lord, Garbhodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, who merges within the body of Mah&#257;-Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Both of these <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;u-tattvas</span> are <span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva-tattvas,</span> and therefore the great sages Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana concentrated always upon the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In this way they could understand that the Supersoul within the heart is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they could recognize their identity with Him. The complete description of this realization is that simply by discharging the unalloyed form of devotional service, one can realize his self completely. The <span class="Italic">parama-bhakti-yoga</span> mentioned in this verse means that a living entity, by dint of unalloyed devotional service, has no other interest than the service of the Lord, as described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">v&#257;sudeva&#7717; sarvam iti</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/19?d=1">7.19</a>]). By <span class="Italic">parama-bhakti-yoga,</span> by elevating oneself to the highest platform of loving service, one can automatically be relieved from the bodily concept of life and see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. As confirmed in <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;:</span></div>

<div class="Translation">After Kavi, Mah&#257;v&#299;ra and Savana were completely trained in the paramaha&#7745;sa stage of life, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven arbudas of years. Whenever he was determined to fix his arrow upon his bowstring with his two powerful arms, all opponents of the regulative principles of religious life would flee from his presence in fear of the unparalleled prowess he displayed in ruling the universe. He greatly loved his wife Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;, and with the increase of days, their exchange of nuptial love also increased. By her feminine behavior as she dressed herself, walked, got up, smiled, laughed, and glanced about, Queen Barhi&#7779;mat&#299; increased his energy. Thus although he was a great soul, he appeared lost in the feminine conduct of his wife. He behaved with her just like an ordinary man, but actually he was a great soul.</div>

<div class="First">In this verse, the word <span class="Italic">dharma-pratipak&#7779;a&#7717;</span> (&ldquo;opponents of religious principles&rdquo;) refers not to a particular faith, but to <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> the division of society, socially and spiritually, into four <span class="Italic">var&#7751;as</span> (<span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a, k&#7779;atriya, vai&#347;ya</span> and <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra</span>) and four <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;ramas</span> (<span class="Italic">brahmacarya, g&#7771;hastha, v&#257;naprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;sa</span>). To maintain proper social order and help the citizens gradually progress toward the goal of life&mdash;namely spiritual understanding&mdash;the principles of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> must be accepted. From this verse, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata appears to have been so strict in maintaining this institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> that anyone neglecting it would immediately flee from his presence as soon as the King warned him by fighting or administering light punishment. Indeed, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata would not have to fight, for simply because of his strong determination, they dared not disobey the rules and regulations of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma.</span> It is said that unless human society is regulated by <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma,</span> it is no better than a bestial society of cats and dogs. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, therefore, strictly maintained <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> by his extraordinary, unparalleled prowess.</div>
<A NAME="67016"></A><div id="67016"> </div>
<div class="Purport">To maintain such a life of strict vigilance, one needs encouragement from his wife. In the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> system, certain classes, such as the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s,</span> do not need encouragement from the opposite sex. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;atriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hasthas,</span> however, actually need the encouragement of their wives in order to execute their duties. Indeed, a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> or <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> cannot properly execute his responsibilities without the association of his wife. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu personally admitted that a <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha</span> must live with a wife. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;atriyas</span> were even allowed to have many wives to encourage them in discharging the duties of government. The association of a good wife is necessary in a life of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and political affairs. To execute his duties properly, therefore. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata took advantage of his good wife Barhi&#7779;mat&#299;, who was always very expert in pleasing her great husband by properly dressing herself, smiling, and exhibiting her feminine bodily features. Queen Barhi&#7779;mat&#299; always kept Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata very encouraged, and thus he executed his governmental duty very properly. In this verse <span class="Italic">iva</span> has twice been used to indicate that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata acted exactly like a henpecked husband and thereby seemed to have lost his sense of human responsibility. Actually, however, he was fully conscious of his position as a spirit soul, although he seemingly behaved like an acquiescent <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> husband. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata thus ruled the universe for eleven <span class="Italic">arbudas</span> of years. One <span class="Italic">arbuda</span> consists of 100,000,000 years, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven such <span class="Italic">arbudas.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">While so excellently ruling the universe, King Priyavrata once became dissatisfied with the circumambulation of the most powerful sun-god. Encircling Sumeru Hill on his chariot, the sun-god illuminates all the surrounding planetary systems. However, when the sun is on the northern side of the hill, the south receives less light, and when the sun is in the south, the north receives less. King Priyavrata disliked this situation and therefore decided to make daylight in the part of the universe where there was night. He followed the orbit of the sun-god on a brilliant chariot and thus fulfilled his desire. He could perform such wonderful activities because of the power he had achieved by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">There is a Bengali saying which describes that someone is so powerful that he can make the night day and the day night. That saying is current because of the prowess of Priyavrata. His activities demonstrate how powerful he became by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is known as Yoge&#347;vara, the master of all mystic powers. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/78?d=1">18.78</a>) it is said wherever there is the master of all mystic powers (<span class="Italic">yatra yoge&#347;vara&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#7717;</span>), victory, fortune and all other opulences are present. Devotional service is so powerful. When a devotee achieves what he wants to accomplish, it is not by his own mystic power but by the grace of the master of mystic power. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a: by His grace, a devotee can accomplish wonderful things unimaginable even to the most powerful scientist.</div>

<div class="Purport">From the description in this verse, it appears that the sun moves. According to modern astronomers, the sun is fixed in one place, surrounded by the solar system, but here we find that the sun is not stationary: it is rotating in a prescribed orbit. This fact is corroborated by <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.52). <span class="Italic">Yasy&#257;jï¿½ay&#257; bhramati sa&#7745;bh&#7771;ta-k&#257;la-cakra&#7717;:</span> the sun is rotating in its fixed orbit in accordance with the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to <span class="Italic">Jyotir Veda,</span> the science of astronomy in the Vedic literature, the sun moves for six months on the northern side of the Sumeru Hill and for six months on the southern side. We have practical experience on this planet that when there is summer in the north there is winter in the south and vice versa. Modern materialistic scientists sometimes present themselves as knowing all the ingredients of the sun, yet they are unable to offer a second sun like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata&rsquo;s.</div>

<div class="Purport">Although Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata devised a very powerful chariot as brilliant as the sun, he had no desire to compete with the sun-god, for a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava never wants to supersede another Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. His purpose was to give abundant benefits in material existence. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura remarks that in the months of April and May the rays of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata&rsquo;s brilliant sun were as pleasing as the rays of the moon, and in October and November, both morning and evening, that sun provided more warmth than the sunshine. In short, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was extremely powerful, and his actions extended his power in all directions.</div>

For a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is possible because the Lord is also known as Urukrama.&rdquo; Urukrama is a name for Lord V&#257;manadeva, who performed the wonderful act of occupying the three worlds with three footsteps. Lord V&#257;manadeva requested three paces of land from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bali, and when Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bali agreed to grant them, the Lord immediately covered the entire world with two footsteps, and for His third step He placed His foot upon Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja&rsquo;s head. &#346;r&#299; Jayadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; says:</div>

<div class="Purport">Because of the material body, every living entity in material existence is always disturbed by <span class="Italic">sad-gu&#7751;a,</span> six whips&mdash;hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, invalidity and death. Furthermore, another <span class="Italic">sad-gu&#7751;a</span> are the mind and five sense organs. Not to speak of a sanctified devotee, even a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la,</span> an outcaste, who is untouchable, is immediately freed from material bondage if he utters the holy name of the Lord even once. Sometimes caste <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> argue that unless one changes his body he cannot be accepted as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> for since the present body is obtained as a result of past actions, one who has in the past acted as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> takes birth in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family. Therefore, they contend, without such a brahminical body, one cannot be accepted as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> Herein it is said, however, that even <span class="Italic">vid&#363;ra-vigata,</span> a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</span>&mdash;a fifth-class untouchable&mdash;is freed if he utters the holy name even once.

Although one cannot see how his body has changed, we must accept, on the grounds of the authoritative statements of the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras,</span> that he changes his body. This is to be understood without arguments. This verse clearly says, <span class="Italic">sa jah&#257;ti bandham:</span> &ldquo;He gives up his material bondage.&rdquo; The body is a symbolic representation of material bondage according to one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Although sometimes we cannot see the gross body changing, chanting the holy name of the Supreme Lord immediately changes the subtle body, and because the subtle body changes, the living entity is immediately freed from material bondage. After all, changes of the gross body are conducted by the subtle body. After the destruction of the gross body, the subtle body takes the living entity from his present gross body to another. In the subtle body, the mind is predominant, and therefore if one&rsquo;s mind is always absorbed in remembering the activities or the lotus feet of the Lord, he is to be understood to have already changed his present body and become purified. Therefore it is irrefutable that a <span class="Italic">ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la,</span> or any fallen or lowborn person, can become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> simply by the method of bona fide initiation.</div>

If one falls down, therefore, his progress might be checked for a certain time, but it will again become manifest at an opportune moment. Although Priyavrata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was serving according to the instructions of N&#257;rada Muni meant for going back home, back to Godhead, he returned to material affairs at the request of his father.

<div class="First">How condemned is the advancement of material knowledge can be understood from the behavior of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata. He performed such wonderful acts as creating another sun, which shined during the night, and creating a chariot so great that its wheels formed vast oceans. These activities are so great that modern scientists cannot even imagine how such things can be done. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata acted very wonderfully in the material field of activities, but because he was dealing in sense gratification&mdash;ruling his kingdom and dancing to the indications of his beautiful wife&mdash;he personally condemned himself. When we think about this example of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata, we can just consider how degraded is the modern civilization of materialistic advancement. Modern so-called scientists and other materialists are very satisfied because they can construct great bridges, roads and machines, but such activities are nothing comparable to those of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata. If Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata could condemn himself in spite of his wonderful activities, how condemned we are in our so-called advancement of material civilization. We can conclude that such advancement has nothing to do with the problems of the living entity entangled within this material world. Unfortunately, modern man does not understand his entanglement and how condemned he is, nor does he know what kind of body he is going to have in the next life. From a spiritual point of view, a great kingdom, beautiful wife and wonderful material activities are all impediments to spiritual advancement. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata had served the great sage N&#257;rada sincerely. Therefore even though he had accepted material opulences, he could not be deviated from his own task. He again became K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. As confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span></div>

Our hearts are meant for the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that one should be fully K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious, thinking of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as He Himself advises (<span class="Italic">man-man&#257; bhava mad-bhakto mad-y&#257;j&#299; m&#257;&#7745; namaskuru</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/65?d=1">18.65</a>]).

If we believe that Brahman is the real truth, we have to place within our hearts the lotus feet of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a did (<span class="Italic">sa vai mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pad&#257;ravindayo&#7717;</span>).

<div class="Purport">Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was able to give up his opulent kingdom, and he also gave up the association of his beautiful wife as if she were a dead body. However beautiful one&rsquo;s wife and however attractive her bodily features, one is no longer interested in her when her body is dead. We praise a beautiful woman for her body, but that same body, when bereft of a spirit soul, is no longer interesting to any lusty man. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata was so strong, by the grace of the Lord, that even though his beautiful wife was alive, he could give up her association exactly like one who is forced to give up the association of a dead wife. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu said:</div>

<div class="First">The example set by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata in marking off different states is still followed. As indicated here, different classes of men are destined to live in different areas, and therefore the boundaries of various tracts of land, which are described here as islands, should be defined by different rivers, forests and hills. This is also mentioned in relation to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu, who was born from the dead body of his father by the manipulation of great sages. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja P&#7771;thu&rsquo;s father was very sinful, and therefore a black man called Ni&#7779;&#257;da was first born from his dead body. The Nai&#7779;&#257;da race was given a place in the forest because by nature they are thieves and rogues. As animals are given places in various forests and hills, men who are like animals are also destined to live there. One cannot be promoted to civilized life unless one comes to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, for by nature one is destined to live in a particular situation according to one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">karma</span> and association with the modes of nature. If men want to live in harmony and peace, they must take to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, for they cannot achieve the highest standard while absorbed in the bodily concept of life. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata divided the surface of the globe into different islands so that each class of men would live peacefully and not clash with the others. The modern idea of nationhood has gradually developed from the divisions made by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata.</div>

<div class="Translation">&ldquo;As a great follower and devotee of the sage N&#257;rada, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata considered hellish the opulences he had achieved by dint of fruitive activities and mystic power, whether in the lower or heavenly planetary systems or in human society.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; has said that the position of a devotee is so superexcellent that a devotee does not consider any material opulence worth having. There are different types of opulences on earth, in the heavenly planets and even in the lower planetary system, known as P&#257;t&#257;la. A devotee, however, knows that they are all material, and consequently he is not at all interested in them. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> <span class="Italic">para&#7745; d&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;v&#257; nivartate.</span> Sometimes <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">jï¿½&#257;n&#299;s</span> voluntarily give up all material opulences to practice their system of liberation and taste spiritual bliss. However, they frequently fall down because artificial renunciation of material opulences cannot endure. One must have a superior taste in spiritual life; then he can give up material opulence. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Priyavrata had already tasted spiritual bliss, and therefore he had no interest in any of the material achievements available in the lower, higher or middle planetary systems.</div>
