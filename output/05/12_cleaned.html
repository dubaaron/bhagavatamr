<div class="Chapter-Desc">Conversation Between Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a and Ja&#7693;a Bharata</div>
<A NAME="70033"></A><div id="70033"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Because Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was still doubtful about his enlightenment, he asked the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> Ja&#7693;a Bharata to repeat his instructions and clarify ideas he could not understand. In this chapter, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a offers his respectful obeisances to Ja&#7693;a Bharata, who was concealing his real position. The King could understand by his speech how exalted and advanced he was in spiritual knowledge. He very much regretted his offense against him. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was bitten by the serpent of ignorance, but was cured by the nectarean words of Ja&#7693;a Bharata. Later, because he was doubtful about the subjects discussed, he made further inquiries, one question after another. First he wanted to be released from the offense he had committed at the lotus feet of Ja&#7693;a Bharata.</div>
</div><A NAME="70034"></A><div id="70034"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was somewhat unhappy at not being able to grasp Ja&#7693;a Bharata&rsquo;s instructions, which were full of meaning that could not be understood by a materialistic person. Therefore Ja&#7693;a Bharata repeated his instructions more clearly. He said that on the surface of the globe all living entities, moving and unmoving, were but transformations of the earth in different ways. The King was very proud of his king&rsquo;s body, but that body was simply another transformation of the earth. Out of his false prestige, the King was misbehaving toward the palanquin carrier. as a master toward a servant, and he was actually very unkind to other living entities. Consequently King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was unfit to give protection to the citizens, and because he was ignorant, he was unfit to be counted among advanced philosophers. Everything in the material world is but a transformation of the earth, although things have different names according to their transformations. Actually the varieties are one and the same, and ultimately all these varieties are vanquished into atoms. Nothing is permanent in this material world. The variety of things and their distinctions are simply mental concoctions. The Absolute Truth is beyond illusion and is manifest in three features&mdash;impersonal Brahman, localized Param&#257;tm&#257; and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, called V&#257;sudeva by His devotees. Unless one is blessed with the dust from the feet of a pure devotee on his head, one cannot possibly become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>Ja&#7693;a Bharata also told about his own previous birth and informed the King that by the grace of the Lord he still remembered all the incidents of his past life. Due to the activities of his past life, Ja&#7693;a Bharata was being very cautious and was therefore assuming the characteristics of a deaf and dumb man to avoid mingling with the material world. Association with the material modes of nature is very powerful. The bad association of materialistic men can be avoided only in the association of devotees. In the association of devotees, one is given an opportunity to render devotional service in nine different ways&mdash;<span class="Italic">&#347;rava&#7751;a&#7745; k&#299;rtana&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;o&#7717; smara&#7751;a&#7745; p&#257;da-sevanam arcana&#7745; vandana&#7745; d&#257;sya&#7745; sakhyam &#257;tma-nivedanam </I>[SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/23-24?d=1">7.5.23</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> In this way, in the association of devotees, one can pass over material association, cross over the ocean of nescience and return home, back to Godhead.</div>

For some reason, these move on the surface of the earth and are called palanquin carriers. Those material transformations which do not move are gross material objects like stones. In any case, the material body is made of earth and stone in the form of feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, torso, throat and head. Upon the shoulders is the wooden palanquin, and within the palanquin is the so-called King of Sauv&#299;ra.

<div class="First">After analyzing the material bodies of the palanquin carrier and the palanquin passenger, Ja&#7693;a Bharata concludes that the real living force is the living entity. The living entity is the offshoot or offspring of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; therefore within this material world, among moving and nonmoving things, the real principle is Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Due to His presence, everything is working, and there are actions and reactions. One who understands Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u as the original cause of everything is to be understood to be perfectly situated in knowledge. Although he was falsely proud of being a king, King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a was not really situated in knowledge. Therefore he was rebuking the palanquin carriers, including the self-realized <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> Ja&#7693;a Bharata. This is the first accusation Ja&#7693;a Bharata made against the King, who was daring to talk to a learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> from the flimsy ground of ignorance, identifying everything with matter. King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a argued that the living entity is within the body and that when the body is fatigued the living entity within must therefore be suffering. It is clearly explained in the following verses that the living entity does not suffer due to the body&rsquo;s fatigue. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; gives an example of a child heavily decorated with ornaments; although the child&rsquo;s body is very delicate, he does not feel fatigue, nor do the parents think that his ornaments should be taken away. The living entity has nothing to do with bodily pains and pleasures. These are simply mental concoctions. An intelligent man will find the original cause of everything. Material combinations and permutations may be a matter of fact in worldly dealings, but actually the living force, the soul, has nothing to do with them. Those who are materially upset take care of the body and manufacture <span class="Italic">daridra-n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> (poor N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a). However, it is not a fact that the soul or Supersoul becomes poor simply because the body is poor. These are the statements of ignorant people. The soul and Supersoul are always apart from bodily pleasure and pain.</div>

When we can understand by an analytical study that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, our knowledge is perfect. Simply understanding the transformations of different energies is partial knowledge.

There is nothing in the phenomenal world that is not produced by the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Aromas from the earth are different scents manufactured and used for different purposes, but the original cause is the earth, nothing else. A waterpot made of earth can be used to carry water for some time, but ultimately the pot is nothing but earth. Therefore there is no difference between the pot and its original ingredient, earth. It is simply a different transformation of the energy. Originally the cause or primary ingredient is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the varieties are only by-products.

By understanding the original cause of different varieties, one can understand everything. If we understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the original cause of everything, we do not need to separately study the subsidiary varieties. Therefore from the very beginning it is said: <span class="Italic">satya&#7745; para&#7745; dh&#299;mahi.</span> One has to concentrate one&rsquo;s understanding on the Supreme Truth, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or V&#257;sudeva.

This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way.

Despite a very rigid life in devotional service, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not consult a spiritual master when he became overly attached to a deer. Consequently he became strongly attached to the deer, and, forgetting his spiritual routine, he fell down.</div>

It is certainly a great fall to go from human life to animal life, but in the case of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja or any devotee, devotional service to the Lord never goes in vain.
