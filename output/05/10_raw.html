<div class="Chapter-Desc">The Discussion Between Ja&#7693;a Bharata and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a</div>
<A NAME="69423"></A><div id="69423"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, now Ja&#7693;a Bharata, was successfully accepted by King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a, ruler of the states known as Sindhu and Sauv&#299;ra. The King forced Ja&#7693;a Bharata to carry his palanquin and chastised him because he did not carry it properly. A carrier of King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a&rsquo;s palanquin was needed, and to fulfill this need the chief carriers found Ja&#7693;a Bharata as the most likely person to do the work. He was therefore forced to carry the palanquin. Ja&#7693;a Bharata, however, did not protest this proud order, but humbly accepted the job and carried the palanquin. While carrying it, however, he was very careful to see that he did not step on an ant, and whenever he saw one, he would stop until the ant had passed. Because of this, he could not keep pace with the other carriers. The King within the palanquin became very disturbed and chastised Ja&#7693;a Bharata with filthy language, but Ja&#7693;a Bharata, being completely freed from the bodily conception, did not protest; he proceeded carrying the palanquin. When he continued as before, the King threatened him with punishment, and being threatened by the King, Ja&#7693;a Bharata began to talk. He protested against the filthy language used by the King when the King chastised him, and the King, hearing the instructions of Ja&#7693;a Bharata, was awakened to his real knowledge. When he came to his consciousness, he understood that he had offended a great, learned and saintly person. At that time he very humbly and respectfully prayed to Ja&#7693;a Bharata. He now wanted to understand the deep meaning of the philosophical words used by Ja&#7693;a Bharata, and with great sincerity, he begged his pardon. He admitted that if one offends the lotus feet of a pure devotee, he is certainly punished by the trident of Lord &#346;iva.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: My dear King, after this, King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a, ruler of the states known as Sindhu and Sauv&#299;ra, was going to Kapil&#257;&#347;rama. When the King&rsquo;s chief palanquin carriers reached the banks of the River Ik&#7779;umat&#299;, they needed another carrier. Therefore they began searching for someone, and by chance they came upon Ja&#7693;a Bharata. They considered the fact that Ja&#7693;a Bharata was very young and strong and had firm limbs. Like cows and asses, he was quite fit to carry loads. Thinking in this way, although the great soul Ja&#7693;a Bharata was unfit for such work, they nonetheless unhesitatingly forced him to carry the palanquin.</div>

<div class="Translation">The palanquin, however, was very erratically carried by Ja&#7693;a Bharata due to his sense of nonviolence. As he stepped forward, he checked before him every three feet to see whether he was about to step on ants. Consequently he could not keep pace with the other carriers. Due to this, the palanquin was shaking, and King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a immediately asked the carriers, &ldquo;Why are you carrying this palanquin unevenly? Better carry it properly.&rdquo;</div>

<div class="First">Although Ja&#7693;a Bharata was forced to carry the palanquin, he did not give up his sympathetic feelings toward the poor ants passing on the road. A devotee of the Lord does not forget his devotional service and other favorable activities, even when he is in a most distressful condition. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was a qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> highly elevated in spiritual knowledge, yet he was forced to carry the palanquin. He did not mind this, but while walking on the road, he could not forget his duty to avoid killing even an ant. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is never envious or unnecessarily violent. There were many ants on the path, but Ja&#7693;a Bharata took care by looking ahead three feet. When the ants were no longer in his way, he would place his foot on the ground. A Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is always very kind at heart to all living entities. In His <span class="Italic">s&#257;&#7749;khya-yoga,</span> Lord Kapiladeva explains: <span class="Italic">suh&#7771;da&#7717; sarva-dehin&#257;m.</span> Living entities assume different bodily forms. Those who are not Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas consider only human society worthy of their sympathy, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a claims to be the supreme father of all life forms. Consequently the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava takes care not to annihilate untimely or unnecessarily any life form. All living entities have to fulfill a certain duration for being encaged in a particular type of material body. They have to finish the duration allotted a particular body before being promoted or evolved to another body. Killing an animal or any other living being simply places an impediment in the way of his completing his term of imprisonment in a certain body. One should therefore not kill bodies for one&rsquo;s sense gratification, for this will implicate one in sinful activity.</div>

<div class="Translation">King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a could understand the speeches given by the carriers, who were afraid of being punished. He could also understand that simply due to the fault of one person, the palanquin was not being carried properly. Knowing this perfectly well and hearing their appeal, he became a little angry, although he was very advanced in political science and was very experienced. His anger arose due to his inborn nature as a king. Actually King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a&rsquo;s mind was covered by the mode of passion, and he therefore spoke as follows to Ja&#7693;a Bharata, whose Brahman effulgence was not clearly visible, being covered like a fire covered by ashes.</div>

<div class="Translation">King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a told Ja&#7693;a Bharata: How troublesome this is, my dear brother. You certainly appear very fatigued because you have carried this palanquin alone without assistance for a long time and for a long distance. Besides that, due to your old age you have become greatly troubled. My dear friend, I see that you are not very firm, nor very strong and stout.

<div class="Translation">In this way the King criticized Ja&#7693;a Bharata with sarcastic words, yet despite being criticized in this way, Ja&#7693;a Bharata had no bodily conception of the situation. He knew that he was not the body, for he had attained his spiritual identity. He was neither fat, lean nor thin, nor had he anything to do with a lump of matter, a combination of the five gross and three subtle elements. He had nothing to do with the material body and its two hands and legs. In other words, he had completely realized his spiritual identity []. He was therefore unaffected by this sarcastic criticism from the King. Without saying anything, he continued carrying the palanquin as before.</div>

<div class="First">Ja&#7693;a Bharata was completely liberated. He did not even care when the dacoits attempted to kill his body; he knew that he certainly was not the body. Even if the body were killed, he would not have cared, for he was thoroughly convinced of the proposition found in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/20?d=1">2.20</a>): <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyam&#257;ne &#347;ar&#299;re.</span> He knew that he could not be killed even if his body were killed. Although he did not protest, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His agent could not tolerate the injustice of the dacoits; therefore he was saved by the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and the dacoits were killed. In this case, while carrying the palanquin, he also knew that he was not the body. This body was very strong and stout, in sound condition and quite competent to carry the palanquin. Due to his being freed from the bodily conception, the sarcastic words of the King did not at all affect him. The body is created according to one&rsquo;s <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and material nature supplies the ingredients for the development of a certain type of body. The soul the body covers is different from the bodily construction; therefore anything favorable or mischievous done to the body does not affect the spirit soul. The Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">asa&#7749;go hy aya&#7745; puru&#7779;a&#7717;:</span> the spirit soul is always unaffected by material arrangements.</div>

Due to madness, he chastised Ja&#7693;a Bharata with uncalled-for and contradictory words. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was a topmost devotee and the dear abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although considering himself very learned, the King did not know about the position of an advanced devotee situated in devotional service, nor did he know his characteristics. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he always carried the form of the Lord within his heart. He was the dear friend of all living beings, and he did not entertain any bodily conception. He therefore smiled and spoke the following words.</div>

<div class="First">The distinction between a person in the bodily conception and a person beyond the bodily conception is presented in this verse. In the bodily conception, King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a considered himself a king and chastised Ja&#7693;a Bharata in so many unwanted ways. Being self-realized, Ja&#7693;a Bharata, who was fully situated on the transcendental platform, did not at all become angry; instead, he smiled and began to deliver his teachings to King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a. A highly advanced Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava devotee is a friend to all living entities, and consequently he is a friend to his enemies also. In fact, he does not consider anyone to be his enemy. <span class="Italic">Suh&#7771;da&#7717; sarva-dehin&#257;m.</span> Sometimes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava becomes superficially angry at a nondevotee, but this is good for the nondevotee. We have several examples of this in Vedic literature. Once N&#257;rada became angry with the two sons of Kuvera, Nalak&#363;vara and Ma&#7751;igr&#299;va, and he chastised them by turning them into trees. The result was that later they were liberated by Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The devotee is situated on the absolute platform, and when he is angry or pleased, there is no difference, for in either case he bestows his benediction.</div>

<div class="Translation">The great br&#257;hma&#7751;a Ja&#7693;a Bharata said: My dear King and hero, whatever you have spoken sarcastically is certainly true. Actually these are not simply words of chastisement, for the body is the carrier. The load carried by the body does not belong to me, for I am the spirit soul. There is no contradiction in your statements because I am different from the body. I am not the carrier of the palanquin; the body is the carrier. Certainly, as you have hinted, I have not labored carrying the palanquin, for I am detached from the body. You have said that I am not stout and strong, and these words are befitting a person who does not know the distinction between the body and the soul. The body may be fat or thin, but no learned man would say such things of the spirit soul. As far as the spirit soul is concerned, I am neither fat nor skinny; therefore you are correct when you say that I am not very stout. Also, if the object of this journey and the path leading there were mine, there would be many troubles for me, but because they relate not to me but to my body, there is no trouble at all.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is stated that one who is advanced in spiritual knowledge is not disturbed by the pains and pleasures of the material body. The material body is completely separate from the spirit soul, and the pains and pleasures of the body are superfluous. The practice of austerity and penance is meant for understanding the distinction between the body and the soul and how the soul can be unaffected by the pleasures and pains of the body. Ja&#7693;a Bharata was actually situated on the platform of self-realization. He was completely aloof from the bodily conception; therefore he immediately took this position and convinced the King that whatever contradictory things the King had said about his body did not actually apply to him as a spirit soul.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear King, you have unnecessarily accused me of being dead though alive. In this regard, I can only say that this is the case everywhere because everything material has its beginning and end. As far as your thinking that you are the king and master and are thus trying to order me, this is also incorrect because these positions are temporary. Today you are a king and I am your servant, but tomorrow the position may be changed, and you may be my servant and I your master. These are temporary circumstances created by providence.</div>

<div class="First">The bodily conception is the basic principle of suffering in material existence. In Kali-yuga especially, people are so uneducated that they cannot even understand that the body is changing at every moment and that the ultimate change is called death. In this life one may be a king, and in the next life one may be a dog, according to <span class="Italic">karma.</span> The spirit soul is in a deep slumber caused by the force of material nature. He is put in one type of condition and again changed into another type. Without self-realization and knowledge, conditional life continues, and one falsely claims himself a king, a servant, a cat or a dog. These are simply different transformations brought about by the supreme arrangement. One should not be misled by such temporary bodily conceptions. Actually no one is master within the material world, for everyone is under the control of material nature, which is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the ultimate master. As explained in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta, ekale &#299;&#347;vara k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, &#257;ra saba bh&#7771;tya:</span> the only master is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, and everyone else is His servant. Forgetfulness of our relationship with the Supreme Lord brings about our suffering in the material world.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: O Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it, when King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a chastised the exalted devotee Ja&#7693;a Bharata with harsh words, that peaceful, saintly person tolerated it all and replied properly. Nescience is due to the bodily conception, and Ja&#7693;a Bharata was not affected by this false conception. Out of his natural humility, he never considered himself a great devotee, and he agreed to suffer the results of his past karma. Like an ordinary man, he thought that by carrying the palanquin, he was destroying the reactions of his past misdeeds. Thinking in this way, he began to carry the palanquin as before.</div>

In all reverse conditions, he agrees to suffer the results of his past life. He never accuses the Lord of putting him into a distressed condition.

<div class="Purport">Through the disciplic succession the royal order was on the same platform as great saintly persons (<span class="Italic">r&#257;ja-&#7771;&#7779;is</span>). Formerly they could understand the philosophy of life and knew how to train the citizens to come to the same standard. In other words, they knew how to deliver the citizens from the entanglement of birth and death. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha ruled Ayodhy&#257;, the great sage Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra once came to him to take away Lord R&#257;macandra and Lak&#7779;ma&#7751;a to the forest to kill a demon. When the saintly person Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra came to the court of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha, the King, in order to receive the saintly person, asked him, <span class="Italic">aihi&#7779;&#7789;a&#7745; yat tat punar janma jay&#257;ya.</span> He asked the sage whether everything was going on well in his endeavor to conquer the repetition of birth and death. The whole process of Vedic civilization is based on this point. We must know how to conquer the repetition of birth and death. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a also knew the purpose of life; therefore when Ja&#7693;a Bharata put the philosophy of life before him, he immediately appreciated it. This is the foundation of Vedic society. Learned scholars, <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> saintly persons and sages who were fully aware of the Vedic purpose advised the royal order how to benefit the general masses, and by their cooperation, the general masses were benefited. Therefore everything was successful. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a attained this perfection of understanding the value of human life; therefore he regretted his insulting words to Ja&#7693;a Bharata, and he immediately descended from his palanquin and fell down at the lotus feet of Ja&#7693;a Bharata in order to be excused and to hear from him further about the values of life known as <span class="Italic">brahma jij�&#257;s&#257;</span> (inquiry into the Absolute Truth). At the present moment, high government officials are ignorant of the values of life, and when saintly persons endeavor to broadcast the Vedic knowledge, the so-called executives do not offer their respectful obeisances but try to obstruct the spiritual propaganda. Thus one can say that the former kingly government was like heaven and that the present government is like hell.</div>

<div class="First">Saintly people like Ja&#7693;a Bharata do not speak ordinary words. Whatever they say is approved by great <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and those advanced in spiritual life. That is the difference between ordinary people and saintly people. The listener must also be advanced to understand the words of such exalted, spiritually advanced people as Ja&#7693;a Bharata. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> was spoken to Arjuna, not to others. Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a especially selected Arjuna for instruction in spiritual knowledge because Arjuna happened to be a great devotee and confidential friend. Similarly, great personalities also speak to the advanced, not to <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras, vai&#347;yas,</span> women or unintelligent men. Sometimes it is very risky to give great philosophical instructions to ordinary people, but &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu, for the benefit of the fallen souls of Kali-yuga, has given us a very nice instrument, the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> The general mass of people, although <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> and less, can be purified by chanting this Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Then they can understand the exalted philosophical statements of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has therefore adopted the chanting of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mah&#257;-mantra</span> for the general masses. When people gradually become purified, they are instructed in the lessons of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Materialistic people like <span class="Italic">str&#299;, &#347;&#363;dra</span> and <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu</span> cannot understand words of spiritual advancement, yet one can take to the shelter of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, for he knows the art of enlightening even <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> in the highly elevated subject matter spoken in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

The soul&rsquo;s fatigue is not factual, but as long as one is immersed in the illusory bodily conception, one is affected by such false dreams. When dreaming, it is not possible to avoid the actual facts, and the conditioned soul is forced to suffer due to his dream. A waterpot is made of earth and is temporary. Actually there is no waterpot; there is simply earth. However, as long as the waterpot can contain water, we can use it in that way. It cannot be said to be absolutely false.</div>

<div class="First">This argument put forward by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a is correct from the practical point of view, but it arises from an attachment to the bodily conception. It can be said that a person sitting in his car is certainly different from his car, but if there is damage to the car, the owner of the car, being overly attached to the car, feels pain. Actually, the damage done to the car has nothing to do with the car&rsquo;s proprietor, but because the proprietor has identified himself with the interest of the car, he feels pleasure and pain connected with it. This conditional state can be avoided if attachment is withdrawn from the car. Then the proprietor would not feel pleasure or pain if the car is damaged or whatever. Similarly, the soul has nothing to do with the body and the senses, but due to ignorance, he identifies himself with the body, and he feels pleasure and pain due to bodily pleasure and pain.</div>

<div class="Translation">My dear sir, you have said that the relationship between the king and the subject or between the master and the servant are not eternal, but although such relationships are temporary, when a person takes the position of a king, his duty is to rule the citizens and punish those who are disobedient to the laws. By punishing them, he teaches the citizens to obey the laws of the state. Again, you have said that punishing a person who is deaf and dumb is like chewing the chewed or grinding the pulp; that is to say, there is no benefit in it. However, if one is engaged in his own occupational duty as ordered by the Supreme Lord, his sinful activities are certainly diminished. Therefore if one is engaged in his occupational duty by force, he benefits because he can vanquish all his sinful activities in that way.</div>

<div class="First">This argument offered by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a is certainly very effective. In his <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhakti-ras&#257;m&#7771;ta-sindhu</span> (1.2.4), &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says, <span class="Italic">tasm&#257;t ken&#257;py up&#257;yena mana&#7717; k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;e nive&#347;ayet:</span> somehow or other, one should engage in K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Actually every living being is an eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, but due to forgetfulness, a living entity engages himself as an eternal servant of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> As long as one is engaged in <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;&rsquo;s</span> service, he cannot be happy. Our K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement aims at engaging people in Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s service. That will help them become freed from all material contamination and sinful activity. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/10?d=1">4.10</a>): <span class="Italic">v&#299;ta-r&#257;ga-bhaya-krodh&#257;&#7717;.</span> By becoming detached from material activities, we will be freed from fear and anger. By austerity, one becomes purified and eligible to return home, back to Godhead. The duty of the king is to rule his citizens in such a way that they can become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious. This would be very beneficial for everyone. Unfortunately the king or president engages people in sense gratification instead of the Lord&rsquo;s service, and such activities are certainly not beneficial for anyone. King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a tried to engage Ja&#7693;a Bharata in carrying the palanquin, which is a form of sense gratification for the King. However, if one is engaged as a palanquin carrier in the Lord&rsquo;s service, that is certainly beneficial. In this godless civilization, if a president engages people somehow or other in devotional service or the awakening of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he renders the very best service to the citizens.</div>

<div class="First">&#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has said that by offending a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, one finishes all his spiritual activities. Offending a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is considered the mad elephant offense. A mad elephant can destroy an entire garden which has been developed with great labor. One may attain the topmost platform of devotional service, but somehow or other if he offends a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, the whole structure collapses. Unconsciously, King Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a offended Ja&#7693;a Bharata, but due to his good sense, he asked to be excused. This is the process by which one can be relieved from a <span class="Italic">vai&#7779;&#7751;ava-apar&#257;dha.</span> K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is always very simple and by nature merciful. When one commits an offense at the feet of a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, one must immediately apologize to such a personality so that his spiritual advancement may not be hampered.</div>
