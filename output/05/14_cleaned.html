<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">The direct meaning of the forest of material existence is given in this chapter. Merchants sometimes enter the forest to collect many rare things and sell them at a good profit in the city, but the forest path is always bedecked with dangers. When the pure soul wants to give up the Lord&rsquo;s service to enjoy the material world, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a certainly gives him a chance to enter the material world. As stated in the <I>P</I><span class="Italic">rema-vivarta:</span> <span class="Italic">k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-bahirmukha ha&#241;&#257; bhoga v&#257;&#241;ch&#257; kare.</span> This is the reason the pure spirit soul falls down to the material world. Due to his activities under the influence of the three modes of material nature, the living entity takes different positions in different species. Sometimes he is a demigod in the heavenly planets and sometimes a most insignificant creature in the lower planetary systems. In this regard, &#346;r&#299;la Narottama d&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura says, <span class="Italic">n&#257;n&#257; yoni sad&#257; phire:</span> the living entity passes through various species. <span class="Italic">Kardarya bhak&#7779;a&#7751;a kare:</span> he is obliged to eat and enjoy abominable things. <span class="Italic">T&#257;ra janma adha&#7717;-p&#257;te y&#257;ya:</span> in this way his whole life is spoiled. Without the protection of an all-merciful Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. the conditioned soul cannot get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;.</span> As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<span class="Italic">mana&#7717; &#7779;a&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;n&#299;ndriy&#257;&#7751;i prak&#7771;ti-sth&#257;ni kar&#7779;ati  </I>[Bg.<B> </B></I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/7?d=1">15.7</a>]), the living entity begins material life with his mind and the five knowledge-acquiring senses, and with these he struggles for existence within the material world. These senses are compared to rogues and thieves within the forest. They take away a man&rsquo;s knowledge and place him in a network of nescience. Thus the senses are like rogues and thieves that plunder his spiritual knowledge. Over and above this, there are family members, wife and children. who are exactly like ferocious animals in the forest. The business of such ferocious animals is to eat a man&rsquo;s flesh. The living entity allows himself to be attacked by jackals and foxes (wife and children), and thus his real spiritual life is finished. In the forest of material life, everyone is envious like mosquitoes, and rats and mice are always creating disturbances. Everyone in this material world is placed in many awkward positions and surrounded by envious people and disturbing animals. The result is that the living entity in the material world is always plundered and bitten by many living entities. Nonetheless, despite these disturbances, he does not want to give up his family life, and he continues his fruitive activities in an attempt to become happy in the future. He thus becomes more and more entangled in the results of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and thus he is forced to act impiously. His witnesses are the sun during the day and the moon during the night. The demigods also witness, but the conditioned soul thinks that his attempts at sense gratification are not being witnessed by anyone. Sometimes, when he is detected, he temporarily renounces everything, but due to his great attachment for the body, his renunciation is given up before he can attain perfection.</div>
</div><A NAME="70654"></A><div id="70654"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>In this material world there are many envious people. There is the tax-exacting government, which is compared to an owl, and there are invisible crickets that create unbearable sounds. The conditioned soul is certainly greatly harassed by the agents of material nature, but his intelligence is lost due to undesirable association. In an attempt to gain relief from the disturbances of material existence, he falls victim to so-called <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s, s&#257;dhus</span> and incarnations who can display some magic but who do not understand devotional service. Sometimes the conditioned soul is bereft of all money, and consequently he becomes unkind to his family members. In this material world there is not a pinch of actual happiness, for which the conditioned soul is longing life after life. The government officials are like carnivorous R&#257;k&#7779;asas who exact heavy taxes for the maintenance of the government. The hard-working conditioned soul is very saddened due to these heavy taxes.</div>
</div><A NAME="70655"></A><div id="70655"> </div>
<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level"><TB>The path of fruitive activities leads to difficult mountains, and sometimes the conditioned soul wants to cross these mountains, but he is never successful, and consequently he becomes more and more aggrieved and disappointed. Becoming materially and financially embarrassed, the conditioned soul unnecessarily chastises his family. In the material condition there are four principal needs, out of which sleep is compared to a python. When asleep, the conditioned soul completely forgets his real existence, and in sleep he does not feel the tribulations of material life. Sometimes, being in need of money, the conditioned soul steals and cheats, although he may apparently be associated with devotees for spiritual advancement. His only business is getting out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;, but</span> due to improper guidance he becomes more and more entangled in material dealings. This material world is simply an embarrassment and is composed of tribulations presented as happiness. distress, attachment, enmity and envy. On the whole it is simply full of tribulation and misery. When a person loses his intelligence due to attachment to wife and sex, his entire consciousness becomes polluted. He thus only thinks of the association of women. The time factor, which is like a serpent, takes away everyone&rsquo;s life, including that of Lord Brahm&#257; and the insignificant ant. Sometimes the conditioned soul tries to save himself from inexorable time and thus takes shelter of some bogus savior. Unfortunately. the bogus savior cannot even save himself. How, then. can he protect others? The bogus saviors do not care for bona fide knowledge received from qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and Vedic sources. Their only business is indulging in sex and recommending sexual freedom even for widows. Thus they are like monkeys in the forest. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; thus explains the material forest and its difficult path to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it.</div>

<div class="Translation">When King Par&#299;k&#7779;it asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; about the direct meaning of the material forest, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; replied as follows: My dear King, a man belonging to the mercantile community [va&#7751;ik] is always interested in earning money. Sometimes he enters the forest to acquire some cheap commodities like wood and earth and sell them in the city at good prices. Similarly, the conditioned soul, being greedy, enters this material world for some material profit. Gradually he enters the deepest part of the forest, not really knowing how to get out. Having entered the material world, the pure soul becomes conditioned by the material atmosphere, which is created by the external energy under the control of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Thus the living entity comes under the control of the external energy, daiv&#299; m&#257;y&#257;. Living independently and bewildered in the forest, he does not attain the association of devotees who are always engaged in the service of the Lord. Once in the bodily conception, he gets different types of bodies one after the other under the influence of material energy and impelled by the modes of material nature [sattva-gu&#7751;a, rajo-gu&#7751;a and tamo-gu&#7751;a]. In this way the conditioned soul goes sometimes to the heavenly planets, sometimes to the earthly planets and sometimes to the lower planets and lower species. Thus he suffers continuously due to different types of bodies. These sufferings and pains are sometimes mixed. Sometimes they are very severe, and sometimes they are not. These bodily conditions are acquired due to the conditioned soul&rsquo;s mental speculation. He uses his mind and five senses to acquire knowledge, and these bring about the different bodies and different conditions. Using the senses under the control of the external energy, m&#257;y&#257;, the living entity suffers the miserable conditions of material existence. He is actually searching for relief, but he is generally baffled, although sometimes he is relieved after great difficulty. Struggling for existence in this way, he cannot get the shelter of pure devotees, who are like bumblebees engaged in loving service at the lotus feet of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</div>

<div class="First">The most important information in this verse is <span class="Italic">hari-guru-cara&#7751;a-aravinda-madhukara-anupadav&#299;m.</span> In this material world the conditioned souls are baffled by their activities, and sometimes they are relieved after great difficulty. On the whole the conditioned soul is never happy. He simply struggles for existence. Actually his only business is to accept the spiritual master, the <span class="Italic">guru,</span> and through him he must accept the lotus feet or the Lord. This is explained by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu: <span class="Italic">guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja.</span> people struggling for existence in the forests or cities of the material world are not actually enjoying life. They are simply suffering different pains and pleasures, generally pains that are always inauspicious. They try to gain release from these pains, but they cannot due to ignorance. For them it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas:</span> <span class="Italic">tad-vij&#241;&#257;n&#257;rtha&#7745; sa gurum ev&#257;bhigacchet </span><span class="Ref_Italic"></B></I>[MU</span></B></I> <PW:Popup,5.125,1.92708,Popup><div class="Verse">tad-vij&#241;&#257;n&#257;rtha&#7745; sa gurum ev&#257;bhigacchet<br>samit-p&#257;&#7751;i&#7717; &#347;rotriya&#7745; brahma-ni&#7779;&#7789;ham</div></div>

<div class="Purport">Since the material world is compared herein to a forest, it may be argued that in Kali-yuga modern civilization is mainly situated in the cities. A great city, however, is like a great forest. Actually city life is more dangerous than life in the forest. If one enters an unknown city without friend or shelter, living in that city is more difficult than living in a forest. There are many big cities all over the surface of the globe, and wherever one looks he sees the struggle for existence going on twenty-four hours a day. people rush about in cars going seventy and eighty miles an hour, constantly coming and going, and this sets the scene of the great struggle for existence. One has to rise early in the morning and travel in that car at breakneck speed. There is always the danger of an accident, and one has to take great care. In his automobile, the living entity is full of anxieties, and his struggle is not at all auspicious. Apart from human beings, other species like cats and dogs are also struggling very hard day and night for existence. Thus the struggle for existence continues, and the conditioned soul changes from one position to another. For a while, he is a child, but he has to become a boy. From a boy, he has to change into a youth, and from youth to manhood and old age. Finally, when the body is no longer workable, he has to accept a new body in a different species. Giving up the body is called death, and accepting another body is called birth. The human form is an opportunity to take shelter of the bona fide spiritual master and, through him, the Supreme Lord. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement has been started to give an opportunity to all the members of human society, who are misled by foolish leaders. No one can get out of this struggle for existence, which is full of miseries, without accepting a pure devotee of the Lord. The material attempt changes from one position to another, and no one actually gains relief from the struggle for existence. The only resort is the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, and, through him, the lotus feet of the Lord.</div>

Unfortunately, when a person is misguided he misuses his high position for sense gratification. Therefore the uncontrolled senses are considered plunderers.

By executing religious principles under the laws of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a-&#347;rama-dharma,</span> one is placed in a comfortable position. One may very easily use his assets for the further advancement of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. One should understand that the wealth and opportunity one gets in the material world should not be squandered in sense gratification. They are meant for the advancement of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. This K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement is therefore teaching people to control the mind and five knowledge-acquiring senses by a definite process. One should practice a little austerity and not spend money on anything other than the regulative life of devotional service. The senses demand that one see beautiful things; therefore money should be spent for decorating the Deity in the temple. Similarly, the tongue has to taste good food, which should be bought and offered to the Deity. The nose can be utilized in smelling the flowers offered to the Deity, and the hearing can be utilized by listening to the vibration of the Hare K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> In this way the senses can be regulated and utilized to advance K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. Thus a good position might not be spoiled by material sense gratification in the form of illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. One spoils an opulent position in the material world by driving cars, spending time in nightclubs or tasting abominable food in restaurants. In these ways. the plundering senses take away all the assets that the conditioned soul has acquired with great difficulty.</div>

Similarly, the children are also like tigers, jackals and foxes.

That gold is the source of material opulence and envy, and it can enable one to afford illicit sex, gambling, meat-eating and intoxication. Those whose minds are overcome by the mode of passion are attracted by the color of gold, just as a man suffering from cold in the forest runs after a phosphorescent light in a marshy land, considering it to be fire.</div>

<div class="First">Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja told Kali-yuga to leave his kingdom immediately and reside in four places: brothels, liquor shops, slaughterhouses and gambling casinos. However, Kali-yuga requested him to give him only one place where these four places are included, and Par&#299;k&#7779;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja gave him the place where gold is stored. Gold encompasses the four principles of sin, and therefore, according to spiritual life, gold should be avoided as far as possible. If there is gold, there is certainly illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Because people in the Western world have a great deal of gold, they are victims of these four sins. The color of gold is very glittering, and a materialistic person becomes very much attracted by its yellow color. However, this gold is actually a type of stool. A person with a bad liver generally passes yellow stool. The color of this stool attracts a materialistic person, just as the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp attracts one who needs heat.</div>

He is so absorbed in the thought of maintaining body and soul together that he forgets his original relationship with K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and seeks only the bodily comforts. Thus material activities are the conditioned soul&rsquo;s only engagement.

Therefore the person is punished in so many ways. presently in Kali-yuga there are many pregnancies due to illicit sex, and sometimes abortions ensue.

<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow anyone to act against the stringent laws of material nature; therefore illicit sex is punished life after life. Illicit sex creates pregnancies, and these unwanted pregnancies lead to abortion. Those involved become implicated in these sins, so much so that they are punished in the same way the next life. Thus in the next life they also enter the womb of a mother and are killed in the same way. All these things can be avoided by remaining on the transcendental platform of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. In this way one does not commit sinful activity. Illicit sex is the most prominent sin due to lusty desire. When one associates with the mode of passion, he is implicated in suffering life after life.</div>

<div class="First">The main disease in material life is the bodily conception. Being baffled again and again in material activity, the conditioned soul temporarily thinks of the futility of material enjoyment, but he again tries the same thing. By the association of devotees, a person may become convinced of the material futility, but he cannot give up his engagement, although he is very eager to return home, back to Godhead. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, compassionately takes away all the material possessions of such a devotee. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> (10.88.8): <span class="Italic">yasy&#257;ham anug&#7771;h&#7751;&#257;mi hari&#7779;ye tad-dhana&#7745; &#347;anai&#7717;.</span> Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says that He takes everything away from the devotee whom He especially favors when that devotee is overly attached to material possessions. When everything is taken away, the devotee feels helpless and frustrated in society, friendship and love. He feels that his family does not care for him any longer, and he therefore completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. This is a special favor granted by the Lord to a devotee who cannot fully surrender to the Lord due to a strong bodily conception. As explained in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/madhya/22/39?d=1">22.39</a>): <span class="Italic">&#257;mi&mdash;vij&#241;a, ei m&#363;rkhe &lsquo;vi&#7779;aya&rsquo; kene diba.</span> The Lord understands the devotee who hesitates to engage in the Lord&rsquo;s service, not knowing whether he should again try to revive his material life. After repeated attempts and failures, he fully surrenders to the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord then gives him directions, and, attaining happiness, he forgets all material engagement.</div>

<div class="Translation">Sometimes, to mitigate distresses in this forest of the material world, the conditioned soul receives cheap blessings from atheists. He then loses all intelligence in their association. This is exactly like jumping in a shallow river. As a result one simply breaks his head. He is not able to mitigate his sufferings from the heat, and in both ways he suffers. The misguided conditioned soul also approaches so-called s&#257;dhus and sv&#257;m&#299;s who preach against the principles of the Vedas.

This is due to the miserable condition experienced in the family. Sometimes, due to misery, one becomes very hardened toward his affectionate sons, daughters and wife. This is but part of the blazing fire of the forest of material life.</div>

<div class="First">Material life is such that due to indulgence in illicit sex, gambling, intoxication and meat-eating, the conditioned soul is always in a dangerous condition. Meat-eating and intoxication excite the senses more and more, and the conditioned soul falls victim to women. In order to keep women, money is required, and to acquire money, one begs, borrows or steals. Indeed, he commits abominable acts that cause him to suffer both in this life and in the next. Consequently illicit sex must be stopped by those who are spiritually inclined or who are on the path of spiritual realization. Many devotees fall down due to illicit sex. They may steal money and even fall down from the highly honored renounced order. Then for a livelihood they accept menial services and become beggars. It is therefore said in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras, yan maithun&#257;di-g&#7771;hamedhi-sukha&#7745; hi tuccham:</I> [SB </span></I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/9/45?d=1">7.9.45</a>] materialism is based on sex, whether licit or illicit.

One suffers more and more in material life. A miserly person cannot properly utilize the wealth he has, and similarly a materialistic person misuses the human form. Instead of using it for spiritual emancipation, he uses the body for sense gratification. Therefore he is called a miser.</div>

<div class="First">This is called <span class="Italic">sa&#7745;s&#257;ra-d&#257;v&#257;nala.</span> Even in ordinary transactions between two people, there is invariably cheating because the conditioned soul is defective in four ways&mdash;he is illusioned, he commits mistakes, his knowledge is imperfect, and he has a propensity to cheat. Unless one is liberated from material conditioning, these four defects must be there. Consequently every man has a cheating propensity, which is employed in business or money transactions. Although two friends may be living peacefully together, due to their propensity to cheat they become enemies when there is a transaction between them. A philosopher accuses an economist of being a cheater, and an economist may accuse a philosopher of being a cheater when he comes in contact with money. In any case, this is the condition of material life. One may profess a high philosophy, but when one is in need of money, he becomes a cheater. In this material world, so-called scientists, philosophers and economists are nothing but cheaters in one way or another. The scientists are cheaters because they present so many bogus things in the name of science. They propose going to the moon, but actually they end up cheating the entire public of large sums of money for their experiments. They cannot do anything useful. Unless one can find a person transcendental to the four basic defects, one should not accept advice and become a victim of the material condition. The best process is to take the advice and instructions of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or His bona fide representative. In this way one can be happy in this life and the next.</div>

Again, he becomes very busy under the shelter of that home and is captivated by the talks, glances and activities of his wife and children.

The more he becomes attached to his wife, the more he becomes implicated in family life. One Bengali poet, Bankim Chandra, says that to the eyes of the lover the beloved is always very beautiful, even though ugly. This attraction is called <span class="Italic">deva-m&#257;y&#257;.</span> The attraction between man and woman is the cause of bondage for both. Actually both belong to the <span class="Italic">par&#257; prak&#7771;ti,</span> the superior energy of the Lord, but both are actually <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti</span> (female). However, because both want to enjoy one another, they are sometimes described as <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a</span> (male). Actually neither is <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a,</span> but both can be superficially described as <span class="Italic">puru&#7779;a.</span> As soon as man and woman are united, they become attached to home, hearth, land, friendship and money. In this way they are both entrapped in material existence. The word <span class="Italic">bhuja-lat&#257;-upag&#363;&#7693;ha,</span> meaning &ldquo;being embraced by beautiful arms which are compared to creepers,&rdquo; describes the way the conditioned soul is bound within this material world.

It expands from the beginning of the atoms up to the time of Brahm&#257;&rsquo;s death, and it controls all activities. It is always revolving and spending the lives of the living entities, from Lord Brahm&#257; down to an insignificant blade of grass. Thus one changes from infancy, to childhood, to youth and maturity, and thus one approaches the end of life. It is impossible to check this wheel of time. This wheel is very exacting because it is the personal weapon of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the conditioned soul, fearing the approach of death, wants to worship someone who can save him from imminent danger. Yet he does not care for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose weapon is the indefatigable time factor. The conditioned soul instead takes shelter of a man-made god described in unauthorized scriptures. Such gods are like buzzards, vultures, herons and crows. Vedic scriptures do not refer to them. Imminent death is like the attack of a lion, and neither vultures, buzzards, crows nor herons can save one from such an attack.

<div class="First">By fulfilling the process of evolution from the aquatics to the animal platform, a living entity eventually reaches the human form. The three modes of material nature are always working in the evolutionary process. Those who come to the human form through the quality of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> were cows in their last animal incarnation. Those who come to the human form through the quality of <span class="Italic">rajo-gu&#7751;a</span> were lions in their last animal incarnation. And those who come to the human form through the quality of <span class="Italic">tamo-gu&#7751;a</span> were monkeys in their last animal incarnation. In this age, those who come through the monkey species are considered by modern anthropologists like Darwin to be descendants of monkeys. We receive information herein that those who are simply interested in sex are actually no better than monkeys. Monkeys are very expert in sexual enjoyment, and sometimes sex glands are taken from monkeys and placed in the human body so that a human being can enjoy sex in old age. In this way modern civilization has advanced. Many monkeys in India were caught and sent to Europe so that their sex glands could serve as replacements for those of old people. Those who actually descend from the monkeys are interested in expanding their aristocratic families through sex. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> there are also certain ceremonies especially meant for sexual improvement and promotion to higher planetary systems, where the demigods are enjoying sex. The demigods are also very much inclined toward sex because that is the basic principle of material enjoyment.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">The monkeylike conditioned soul first becomes attached to sex. and when intercourse actually takes place he becomes more attached. He then requires some material comforts&mdash;apartment, house, food, friends. wealth and so on. In order to acquire these things he has to cheat others, and this creates enmity even among the most intimate friends. Sometimes this enmity is created between the conditioned soul and the father or spiritual master. Unless one is firmly fixed in the regulative principles, one may perform mischievous acts, even if one is a member of the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. We therefore advise our disciples to strictly follow the regulative principles; otherwise the most important movement for the upliftment of humanity will be hampered due to dissension among its members. Those who are serious about pushing forward this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement should remember this and strictly follow the regulative principles so that their minds will not be disturbed.</div>

Even if one acquires riches by unfair means, he cannot avoid punishment and insult from the government or the general populace. There are many instances of important people&rsquo;s embezzling money, getting caught and being put in prison. One may be able to avoid the punishment of prison, but one cannot avoid the punishment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who works through the agency of material nature.

In either case, the path is full of danger. Sometimes the conditioned soul is separated from his father by death or other circumstances.

Sometimes he is happy maintaining his family, and sometimes he is overjoyed and sings melodiously. In this way he becomes entangled and forgets his separation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead since time immemorial. Thus he traverses the dangerous path of material existence, and on this path he is not at all happy. Those who are self-realized simply take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to get out of this dangerous material existence.

<div class="First">The name of God is K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, because He is so attractive that the pure devotee can give up everything within this material world on His behalf. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was an ideal king, instructor and emperor of the world. He possessed all the opulences of the material world, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is so attractive that He attracted Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata from all his material possessions. Yet somehow or other, the King became affectionate to a little deer and, falling from his position, had to accept the body of a deer in his next life. Due to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s great mercy upon him, he could not forget his position, and he could understand how he had fallen. Therefore in the next life, as Ja&#7693;a Bharata, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was careful not to spoil his energy, and therefore he presented himself as a deaf and dumb person. In this way he could concentrate on his devotional service. We have to learn from the great King Bharata how to become cautious in cultivating K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. A little inattention will retard our devotional service for the time being.

Indeed, even liberation is considered insignificant for those whose minds are attracted to the loving service of the Lord.</div>

<div class="First">This verse confirms K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s all-attractiveness. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was so attracted to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a that he gave up all his material possessions. Generally materialistic people are attracted by such possessions.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;One becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life&rsquo;s illusions and thinks in terms of &lsquo;I and mine.&rsquo; &rdquo; The attraction for material things is certainly due to illusion. There is no value in attraction to material things, for the conditioned soul is diverted by them. One&rsquo;s life is successful if he is absorbed in the attraction of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&rsquo;s strength, beauty and pastimes as described in the Tenth Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s are attracted to merging into the existence of the Lord, but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is more attractive than the desire to merge. The word <span class="Italic">abhava&#7717;</span> means &ldquo;not to take birth again in this material world.&rdquo; A devotee doesn&rsquo;t care whether he is going to be reborn or not. He is simply satisfied with the Lord&rsquo;s service in any condition. That is real <span class="Italic">mukti.</span></div>

<div class="Translation">Even though in the body of a deer, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata did not forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore when he was giving up the body of a deer, he loudly uttered the following prayer: &ldquo;The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sacrifice personified. He gives the results of ritualistic activity. He is the protector of religious systems, the personification of mystic yoga, the source of all knowledge, the controller of the entire creation, and the Supersoul in every living entity.

I am quitting this body offering obeisances unto Him and hoping that I may perpetually engage in His transcendental loving service.&rdquo; Uttering this, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata left his body.</div>

Although Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had to accept the body of a deer, he could remember N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a at the time of death. Consequently he took birth as a perfect devotee in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family.

Because he was very cautious within his deer body, he took birth in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> family as Ja&#7693;a Bharata. During this lifetime, he remained perfectly K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and preached the gospel of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness directly, beginning with his instructions to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a. In this regard, the word <span class="Italic">yog&#257;ya</span> is very significant. The purpose of <span class="Italic">a&#7779;&#7789;&#257;&#7749;ga-yoga,</span> as stated by Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya, is to link or connect with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<div class="First">The forest of material existence is summarized in this Fourteenth Chapter. The word <span class="Italic">bhav&#257;&#7789;av&#299;</span> refers to the path of material existence. The merchant is the living entity who comes to the forest of material existence to try to make money for sense gratification. The six plunderers are the senses&mdash;eyes, ears, nose, tongue, touch and mind. The bad leader is diverted intelligence. Intelligence is meant for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness. but due to material existence we divert all our intelligence to achieve material facilities. Everything belongs to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but due to our perverted mind and senses. we plunder the property of the Lord and engage in satisfying our senses. The jackals and tigers in the forest are our family members, and the herbs and creepers are our material desires. The mountain cave is our happy home, and the mosquitoes and serpents are our enemies. The rats, beasts and vultures are different types of thieves who take away our possessions, and the <span class="Italic">gandharva-pura</span> is the phantasmagoria of the body and home. The will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp is our attraction for gold and its color, and material residence and wealth are the ingredients for our material enjoyment. The whirlwind is our attraction for our wife, and the dust storm is our blinding passion experienced during sex. The demigods control the different directions, and the cricket is the harsh words spoken by our enemy during our absence. The owl is the person who directly insults us, and the impious trees are impious men. The waterless river represents atheists who give us trouble in this world and the next. The meat-eating demons are the government officials, and the pricking thorns are the impediments of material life. The little taste experienced in sex is our desire to enjoy another&rsquo;s wife, and the flies are the guardians of women, like the husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law and so forth. The creeper itself is women in general. The lion is the wheel of time, and the herons, crows and vultures are so-called demigods, pseudo <span class="Italic">sv&#257;m&#299;s, yog&#299;s</span> and incarnations. All of these are too insignificant to give one relief. The swans are the perfect <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as,</span> and the monkeys are the extravagant <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The trees of the monkeys are our households, and the elephant is ultimate death. Thus all the constituents of material existence are described in this chapter.</div>
