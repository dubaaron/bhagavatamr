<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter the descendants of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and many other kings are described. The son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was named Sumati. He followed the path of liberation given by &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva. Some people mistakenly thought Sumati to be the direct incarnation of Lord Buddha. The son of Sumati was Devat&#257;jit, and his son was Devadyumna. Devadyumna&rsquo;s son was Parame&#7779;&#7789;h&#299;, and his son was Prat&#299;ha. Prat&#299;ha was a very great devotee of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and he had three sons, named Pratihart&#257;, Prastot&#257; and Udg&#257;t&#257;. Pratihart&#257; had two sons, Aja and Bh&#363;m&#257;. The son of Bh&#363;m&#257; was Udg&#299;tha, and the son of Udg&#299;tha was Prast&#257;va. The son of Prast&#257;va was Vibhu, and the son of Vibhu was P&#7771;thu&#7779;e&#7751;a, whose son was Nakta. The wife of Nakta, Druti, gave birth to Gaya, who was a very famous and saintly king. Actually King Gaya was a partial incarnation of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and because of his great devotion to Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u he received the title Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a. King Gaya had sons named Citraratha, Sumati and Avarodhana. The son of Citraratha was the emperor Samr&#257;&#7789;, and his son was Mar&#299;ci, whose son was Bindu. Bindu&rsquo;s son was Madhu, and Madhu&rsquo;s son was V&#299;ravrata. V&#299;ravrata&rsquo;s two sons were Manthu and Pramanthu, and the son of Manthu was Bhauvana. The son of Bhauvana was Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257;, and the son of Tva&#7779;&#7789;&#257; was Viraja, who glorified the whole dynasty. Viraja had one hundred sons and one daughter. Of these, the son named &#346;atajit became very famous.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; continued: The son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata known as Sumati followed the path of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, but some unscrupulous people imagined him to be Lord Buddha himself. These people, who were actually atheistic and of bad character, took up the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities. Thus these sinful people accepted Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagated the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati. In this way they were carried away by mental concoction.</div>

<div class="First">Those who are &#256;ryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the <span class="Italic">&#257;rya-sam&#257;ja,</span> which is ignorant of the import of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in the <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;</span> system. Their leaders decry all bona fide <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas,</span> and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;ryas</span> who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the <span class="Italic">&#257;rya-sam&#257;jas,</span> or the Jains. Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha. Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they claim to be the descendants of &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva. Those who are Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>) K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a says, <span class="Italic">vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;:</span> &ldquo;The real purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to understand Me.&rdquo; This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures. One who does not know the greatness of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a cannot be accepted as an &#256;ryan. Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of <span class="Italic">bh&#257;gavata-dharma.</span> He preached almost exclusively among atheists. Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit. Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God. Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God.</div>

Nakta&rsquo;s wife was Druti, and from her womb the great King Gaya was born. Gaya was very famous and pious; he was the best of saintly kings. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and His expansions, who are meant to protect the universe, are always situated in the transcendental mode of goodness, known as vi&#347;uddha-sattva. Being the direct expansion of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, King Gaya was also situated in the vi&#347;uddha-sattva. Because of this, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya was fully equipped with transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was called Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a.</div>

<div class="Translation">King Gaya gave full protection and security to the citizens so that their personal property would not be disturbed by undesirable elements. He also saw that there was sufficient food to feed all the citizens. [This is called po&#7779;a&#7751;a.] He would sometimes distribute gifts to the citizens to satisfy them. [This is called pr&#299;&#7751;ana.] He would sometimes call meetings and satisfy the citizens with sweet words. [This is called upal&#257;lana.] He would also give them good instructions on how to become first-class citizens. [This is called anu&#347;&#257;sana.] Such were the characteristics of King Gaya&rsquo;s royal order. Besides all this, King Gaya was a householder who strictly observed the rules and regulations of household life. He performed sacrifices and was an unalloyed pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was called Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a because as a king he gave the citizens all facilities, and as a householder he executed all his duties so that at the end he became a strict devotee of the Supreme Lord. As a devotee, he was always ready to give respect to other devotees and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. This is the bhakti-yoga process. Due to all these transcendental activities, King Gaya was always free from the bodily conception. He was full in Brahman realization, and consequently he was always jubilant. He did not experience material lamentation. Although he was perfect in all respects, he was not proud, nor was he anxious to rule the kingdom.</div>

<div class="First">As Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a states in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> when He descends on earth, He has two types of business&mdash;to give protection to the faithful and annihilate the demons (<span class="Italic">paritr&#257;&#7751;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;&#7745; vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca du&#7779;k&#7771;t&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/8?d=1">4.8</a>]). Since the king is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is sometimes called <span class="Italic">nara-deva,</span> that is, the Lord as a human being. According to the Vedic injunctions, he is worshiped as God on the material platform. As a representative of the Supreme Lord, the king had the duty to protect the citizens in a perfect way so that they would not be anxious for food and protection and so that they would be jubilant. The king would supply everything for their benefit, and because of this he would levy taxes. If the king or government otherwise levies taxes on the citizens, he becomes responsible for the sinful activities of the citizens. In Kali-yuga, monarchy is abolished because the kings themselves are subjected to the influence of Kali-yuga. It is understood from the <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</span> that when Bibh&#299;&#7779;a&#7751;a became friends with Lord R&#257;macandra, he promised that if by chance or will he broke the laws of friendship with Lord R&#257;macandra, he would become a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> or a king in Kali-yuga. In this age, as Bibh&#299;&#7779;a&#7751;a indicated, both <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and kings are in a wretched condition. Actually there are no kings or <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> in this age, and due to their absence the whole world is in a chaotic condition and is always in distress. Compared to present standards, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya was a true representative of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; therefore he was known as Mah&#257;puru&#7779;a.</div>

<div class="Translation">Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the br&#257;hma&#7751;as in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya&rsquo;s munificent charities. Consequently the br&#257;hma&#7751;as contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya&rsquo;s benefit in the next life.</div>

<div class="First">As a <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> or emperor, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought for religious principles. Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life. Thus the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas</span> were all satisfied with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya because of his proper administration. In other words. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya satisfied the <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriya</span> kings by his fighting and satisfied the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> by his charities. The <span class="Italic">vai&#347;yas</span> were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya&rsquo;s constant sacrifices, the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras</span> were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity. In this way Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya kept all the citizens very satisfied. When <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and saintly persons are honored, they part with their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service. Therefore, as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/34?d=1">4.34</a>), <span class="Italic">tad viddhi pra&#7751;ip&#257;tena paripra&#347;nena sevay&#257;:</span> one should try to approach a spiritual master submissively and render service unto him.</div>
