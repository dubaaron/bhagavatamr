<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">Although Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was very elevated, he fell down due to his attachment to a young deer. One day after Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had taken his bath as usual in the River Ga&#7751;&#7693;ak&#299; and was chanting his <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> he saw a pregnant deer come to the river to drink water. Suddenly there could be heard the thundering roar of a lion, and the deer was so frightened that it immediately gave birth to its calf. It then crossed the river, but died immediately thereafter. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata took compassion upon the motherless calf, rescued it from the water, took it to his <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> and cared for it affectionately. He gradually became attached to this young deer and always thought of it affectionately. As it grew up, it became Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata&rsquo;s constant companion, and he always took care of it. Gradually he became so absorbed in thinking of this deer that his mind became agitated. As he became more attached to the deer, his devotional service slackened. Although he was able to give up his opulent kingdom, he became attached to the deer. Thus he fell down from his mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice. Once when the deer was absent, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was so disturbed that he began to search for it. While searching and lamenting the deer&rsquo;s absence, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata fell down and died. Because his mind was fully absorbed thinking of the deer, he naturally took his next birth from the womb of a deer. However, because he was considerably advanced spiritually, he did not forget his past activities, even though he was in the body of a deer. He could understand how he had fallen down from his exalted position, and remembering this, he left his mother deer and again went to Pulaha-&#257;&#347;rama. He finally ended his fruitive activities in the form of a deer, and when he died he was released from the deer&rsquo;s body.</div>

<div class="First">The laws of nature work in subtle ways unknown to us. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata was a great king very advanced in devotional service. He had almost reached the point of loving service to the Supreme Lord, but even from that platform he could fall down onto the material platform. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> we are therefore warned:</div>

<A NAME="68944"></A><div id="68944"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Spiritual salvation and liberation from material bondage must be worked out with great caution, otherwise a little discrepancy will cause one to fall down again into material existence. By studying the activities of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata, we can learn the art of becoming completely freed from all material attachment. As it will be revealed in later verses, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had to accept the body of a deer due to being overly compassionate for this infant deer. We should be compassionate by raising one from the material platform to the spiritual platform; otherwise at any moment our spiritual advancement may be spoiled, and we may fall down onto the material platform. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata&rsquo;s compassion for the deer was the beginning of his falldown into the material world.</div>

<div class="Translation">Gradually Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata became very affectionate toward the deer. He began to raise it and maintain it by giving it grass. He was always careful to protect it from the attacks of tigers and other animals. When it itched, he petted it, and in this way he always tried to keep it in a comfortable condition. He sometimes kissed it out of love. Being attached to raising the deer, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata forgot the rules and regulations for the advancement of spiritual life, and he gradually forgot to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After a few days, he forgot everything about his spiritual advancement.</div>

It does not know anyone but me; therefore I should not be envious and think that for the deer my own welfare will be destroyed. I should certainly raise, protect, gratify and fondle it.

<div class="First">When a person is advanced in spiritual consciousness or K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, he naturally becomes very sympathetic toward all living entities suffering in the material world. Naturally such an advanced person thinks of the suffering of the people in general. However, if one does not know of the material sufferings of fallen souls and becomes sympathetic because of bodily comforts, as in the case of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, such sympathy or compassion is the cause of one&rsquo;s downfall. If one is actually sympathetic to fallen, suffering humanity, he should try to elevate people from material consciousness to spiritual consciousness. As far as the deer was concerned, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja became very sympathetic, but he forgot that it was impossible for him to elevate a deer to spiritual consciousness, because, after all, a deer is but an animal. It was very dangerous for Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to sacrifice all his regulative principles simply to take care of an animal. The principles enunciated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> should be followed. <span class="Italic">Ya&#7745; hi na vyathayanty ete puru&#7779;a&#7745; puru&#7779;ar&#7779;abha.</span> As far as the material body is concerned, we cannot do anything for anyone. However, by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, we may raise a person to spiritual consciousness if we ourselves follow the rules and regulations. If we give up our own spiritual activities and simply become concerned with the bodily comforts of others, we will fall into a dangerous position.</div>

In this way everyone advances spiritually by the grace of the Lord. For our instruction, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja acted in such a way. We should be very careful not to be misled by so-called welfare activities conducted in bodily, terms. One should not give up his interest in attaining the favor of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u at any cost. Generally people do not know this, or they forget it. Consequently they sacrifice their original interest, the attainment of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&rsquo;s favor, and engage in philanthropic activities for bodily comfort.</div>

What, then. was the use of his renouncing his family? One who is serious in advancing his spiritual life should be very cautious not to become attached to anything but K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. Sometimes, in order to preach. we have to accept many material activities, but we should remember that everything is for K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. If we remember this, there is no chance of our being victimized by material activities.</div>

In other words, if one&rsquo;s mind is distracted from worship, a mere show of worship will not be of any benefit. The fact that Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had to get up at intervals to look for the deer was simply a sign that he had fallen down from the spiritual platform.</div>

In <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;</span> (5.54) it is said, <span class="Italic">karm&#257;&#7751;i nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bh&#257;j&#257;m:</span> &ldquo;For those engaged in devotional service, <span class="Italic">bhakti-bhajana,</span> the results of past deeds are indemnified.&rdquo; According to this, Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja could not be punished for his past misdeeds. The conclusion must be that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata purposefully became over-addicted to the deer and neglected his spiritual advancement. To immediately rectify his mistake, for a short time he was awarded the body of a deer. This was just to increase his desire for mature devotional service. Although Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was awarded the body of an animal, he did not forget what had previously happened due to his purposeful mistake. He was very anxious to get out of his deer body, and this indicates that his affection for devotional service was intensified, so much so that he was quickly to attain perfection in a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> body in the next life. It is with this conviction that we declare in our <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine that devotees like the <span class="Italic">gosv&#257;m&#299;s</span> living in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana who purposely commit some sinful activity are born in the bodies of dogs, monkeys and tortoises in that holy land. Thus they take on these lower life forms for a short while. and after they give up those animal bodies, they are again promoted to the spiritual world. Such punishment is only for a short period, and it is not due to past <span class="Italic">karma.</span> It may appear to be due to past <span class="Italic">karma,</span> but it is offered to rectify the devotee and bring him to pure devotional service.</div>

<div class="Translation">At the time of death, the King saw that the deer was sitting by his side, exactly like his own son, and was lamenting his death. Actually the mind of the King was absorbed in the body of the deer, and consequently&mdash;like those bereft of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness&mdash;he left the world, the deer, and his material body and acquired the body of a deer. However, there was one advantage. Although he lost his human body and received the body of a deer, he did not forget the incidents of his past life.</div>

<div class="Purport">After quitting his body, a person gets another body according to his mental condition at the time of death. At death, a person always think; of that subject matter in which he has been engrossed during his life. According to this law, because Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was always thinking of the deer and forgetting his worship of the Supreme Lord, he acquired the body of a deer. However, due to his having been elevated to the topmost platform of devotional service, he did not forget the incidents of his past life. This special benediction saved him from further deterioration. Due to his past activities in devotional service, he became determined to finish his devotional service even in the body of a deer. It is therefore said in this verse, <span class="Italic">m&#7771;tam,</span> although he had died, <span class="Italic">anu,</span> afterwards, <span class="Italic">na m&#7771;ta janm&#257;nusm&#7771;tir itaravat,</span> he did not forget the incidents of his past life as others forget them.

It is proved herein that due to the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee is never vanquished. Due to his willful neglect of devotional service, a devotee may be punished for a short time, but he again revives his devotional service and returns home. back to Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">Due to his stringent execution of devotional service. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata could remember the activities of his past life and how he was raised to the spiritual platform. Due to his foolishness, he became attached to an insignificant deer and thus fell down and had to accept the body of a deer. This is significant for every devotee. If we misuse our position and think that we are fully engaged in devotional service and can do whatever we like, we have to suffer like Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and be condemned to accept the type of body that impairs our devotional service. Only the human form is able to execute devotional service, but if we voluntarily give this up for sense gratification, we certainly have to be punished. This punishment is not exactly like that endured by an ordinary materialistic person. By the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee is punished in such a way that his eagerness to attain the lotus feet of Lord V&#257;sudeva is increased. By his intense desire, he returns home in the next lifetime. Devotional service is very completely described here: <span class="Italic">tad-anu&#347;rava&#7751;a-manana-sa&#7749;k&#299;rtan&#257;r&#257;dhan&#257;nusmaran&#257;bhiyogena.</span> The constant hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord is recommended in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;:</span> <span class="Italic">satata&#7745; k&#299;rtayanto m&#257;&#7745; yatanta&#347; ca d&#7771;&#7693;ha-vrat&#257;&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/14?d=1">9.14</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who have taken to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness should be very careful that not a single moment is wasted and that not a single moment is spent without chanting and remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His activities. By His own actions and by the actions of His devotees, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a teaches us how to become cautious in devotional service. Through the medium of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a teaches us that we must be careful in the discharge of devotional service. If we want to keep our minds completely fixed without deviation, we must engage them in devotional service full time. As far as the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness are concerned, they have sacrificed everything to push on this K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness movement. Yet they must take a lesson from the life of Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja to be very cautious and to see that not a single moment is wasted in frivolous talk, sleep or voracious eating. Eating is not prohibited, but if we eat voraciously we shall certainly sleep more than required. Sense gratification ensues, and we may be degraded to a lower life form. In that way our spiritual progress may be checked at least for the time being. The best course is to take the advice of &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;: <span class="Italic">avyartha-k&#257;latvam</I> [Cc.</I></span>Madhya <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/madhya/23/18-19?d=1">23.18</a>-19]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">We</span> should see that every moment of our lives is utilized for the rendering of devotional service and nothing else.

<div class="Translation">Remaining in that &#257;&#347;rama, the great King Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was now very careful not to fall victim to bad association. Without disclosing his past to anyone, he remained in that &#257;&#347;rama and ate dry leaves only. He was not exactly alone, for he had the association of the Supersoul. In this way he waited for death in the body of a deer. Bathing in that holy place, he finally gave up that body.</div>

<div class="First">Holy places like V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, Hardwar, Pray&#257;ga and Jagann&#257;tha Pur&#299; are especially meant for the execution of devotional service. V&#7771;nd&#257;vana specifically is the most exalted and preferred holy place for Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava devotees of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a who are aspiring to return back to Godhead, the Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha planets. There are many devotees in V&#7771;nd&#257;vana who regularly bathe in the Yamun&#257;, and this cleanses all the contamination of the material world. By constantly chanting and hearing the holy names and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, one certainly becomes purified and becomes a fit candidate for liberation. However, if one purposefully falls victim to sense gratification, he has to be punished, at least for one lifetime, like Bharata Mah&#257;r&#257;ja.</div>
