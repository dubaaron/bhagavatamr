<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, begot a hundred sons, and during the reign of those sons the world was very happy in all respects. When &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva appeared as the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, He was appreciated by the people as the most exalted and beautiful personality of that age. His poise, influence, strength, enthusiasm, bodily luster and other transcendental qualities were beyond compare. The word <span class="Italic">&#7771;&#7779;abha</span> refers to the best, or the supreme. Due to the superexcellent attributes of the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, the King named his son &#7770;&#7779;abha, or &ldquo;the best.&rdquo; His influence was incomparable. Although there was a scarcity of rain, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva did not care for Indra, the King of heaven, who is in charge of supplying rain. Through His own potency, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva sumptuously covered Ajan&#257;bha with ample rain. Upon receiving &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as his son, King N&#257;bhi began to raise Him very carefully. After that, he entrusted the ruling power to Him and, retiring from family life, lived at Badarik&#257;&#347;rama completely engaged in the worship of V&#257;sudeva, the Supreme Lord. To follow social customs, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva for a while became a student in the <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> and after returning. He followed the orders of His <span class="Italic">guru</span> and accepted a wife named Jayant&#299;, who had been given to Him by the King of heaven, Indra. He begot a hundred sons in the womb of Jayant&#299;. Of these hundred sons, the eldest was known as Bharata. Since the reign of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Bharata, this planet has been called Bh&#257;rata-var&#7779;a. &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s other sons were headed by Ku&#347;&#257;varta, Il&#257;varta, Brahm&#257;varta, Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indrasp&#7771;k, Vidarbha and K&#299;ka&#7789;a. There were also other sons named Kavi, Havi, Antarik&#7779;a, Prabuddha, Pippal&#257;yana, Avirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabh&#257;jana. Instead of ruling the kingdom, these nine became mendicant preachers of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a consciousness, following the religious precepts of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Their characteristics and activities are described in the Eleventh Canto of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> during the talks between Vasudeva and N&#257;rada at Kuruk&#7779;etra. To teach the general populace, King &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva performed many sacrifices and taught His sons how to rule the citizens.</div>

<div class="Translation">&#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said: As soon as the Lord was born as the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, He manifested symptoms of the Supreme Lord, such as marks on the bottoms of His feet [the flag, thunderbolt, etc.]. This son was equal to everyone and very peaceful. He could control His senses and His mind, and, possessing all opulence, He did not hanker for material enjoyment. Endowed with all these attributes, the son of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi became more powerful day after day. Due to this, the citizens, learned br&#257;hma&#7751;as, demigods and ministers wanted &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva to be appointed ruler of the earth.</div>

<div class="First">In these days of cheap incarnations, it is very interesting to note the bodily symptoms found in an incarnation. From the very beginning of His birth, it was observed that &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva&rsquo;s feet were marked with the transcendental signs (a flag, thunderbolt, lotus flower, etc.). In addition to this, as the Lord began to grow, He became very prominent. He was equal to everyone. He did not favor one person and neglect another. An incarnation of God must have the six opulences&mdash;wealth. strength, knowledge, beauty, fame and renunciation. It is said that although &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva was endowed with all opulences, He was not at all attached to material enjoyment. He was self-controlled and therefore liked by everyone. Due to His superexcellent qualities, everyone wanted Him to rule the earth. An incarnation of God has to be accepted by experienced people and by the symptoms described in the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> <span class="Italic">An</span> incarnation is not accepted simply by the adulation of foolish people.</div>

When the father, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi, saw all these qualities, he thought his son to be the best of human beings or the supreme being.

Then, by His own prowess, through yogam&#257;y&#257; [His internal potency], He profusely poured water upon His own place, which was known as Ajan&#257;bha.</div>

<div class="First">We find the word <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> used twice in this verse. Both King Indra and &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, are described as <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n.</span> Sometimes N&#257;rada and Lord Brahm&#257; are also addressed as <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n.</span> The word <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> means that one is a very opulent and powerful person like Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord &#346;iva, N&#257;rada or Indra. They are all addressed as <span class="Italic">bhagav&#257;n</span> due to their extraordinary opulence. King &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, and therefore He was the original Bhagav&#257;n. Consequently He is described herein as <span class="Italic">yoge&#347;vara,</span> which indicates that He has the most powerful spiritual potency. He is not dependent on King Indra for water. He can supply water Himself, and He did so in this case. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> it is stated: <span class="Italic">yaj�&#257;d bhavati parjanya&#7717;</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/3/14?d=1">3.14</a>]<span class="Italic">.</span> Due to the performance of <span class="Italic">yaj�a,</span> clouds of water are manifest in the sky. Clouds and rainfall are under the management of Indra, the heavenly King, but when Indra is neglectful, the Supreme Lord Himself, who is also known as <span class="Italic">yaj�a</span> or <span class="Italic">yaj�a-pati,</span> takes the task upon Himself. Consequently there was sufficient rainfall in the place named Ajan&#257;bha. When <span class="Italic">yaj�a-pati</span> wants to, He can do anything without the help of any subordinate. Therefore the Supreme Lord is known as almighty. In the present age of Kali there will eventually be a great scarcity of water (<span class="Italic">an&#257;v&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;i</span>), for the general populace, due to ignorance and the scarcity of yaj�ic ingredients, will neglect to perform <span class="Italic">yaj�as.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> therefore advises: <span class="Italic">yaj�ai&#7717; sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yai&#7717; yajanti hi sumedhasa&#7717;.</span> After all, <span class="Italic">yaj�a</span> is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age of Kali. there is great scarcity and ignorance; nonetheless, everyone can perform <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj�a.</span> Every family in every society can conduct <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj�a</span> at least every evening. In this way there will be no disturbance or scarcity of rain. It is essential for the people in this age to perform the <span class="Italic">sa&#7749;k&#299;rtana-yaj�a</span> in order to be materially happy and to advance spiritually.</div>

Out of His supreme good will, the Lord became his son and dealt with everyone as if He were an ordinary human being. Thus King N&#257;bhi began to raise his transcendental son with great affection, and he was overwhelmed with transcendental bliss, joy and devotion.</div>

<div class="First">The word <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> is used in the sense of illusion. Considering the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be his own son, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi was certainly in illusion, but this was transcendental illusion. This illusion is required; otherwise how can one accept the supreme father as his own son? The Supreme Lord appears as the son of one of His devotees, just as Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a appeared as the son of Ya&#347;od&#257; and Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. These devotees could never think of their son as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for such appreciation would hamper their relationship of paternal love.</div>

Then Mah&#257;r&#257;ja N&#257;bhi and his wife, Merudev&#299;, went to Badarik&#257;&#347;rama in the Himalaya Mountains, where the King engaged Himself very expertly in austerities and penances with great jubilation.

<div class="Purport">This is the way of Vedic life. One must stop the process of repeated birth and death and return home, back to Godhead. The words <span class="Italic">tan-mahim&#257;nam av&#257;pa</span> are significant in this regard. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; says that <span class="Italic">mahim&#257;</span> means liberation in this life. We should act in such a way in this life that after giving up this body, we will become liberated from the bondage of repeated birth and death. This is called <span class="Italic">j&#299;van-mukti.</span> &#346;r&#299;la V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya states that in the <span class="Italic">Ch&#257;ndogya Upani&#7779;ad</span> there are eight symptoms of a <span class="Italic">j&#299;van-mukta,</span> a person who is already liberated even when living in this body. The first symptom of one so liberated is that he is freed from all sinful activity (<span class="Italic">apahata-p&#257;pa</span>). As long as one is under the clutches of <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;</span> in the material energy, one has to engage in sinful activity. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> describes such people as <span class="Italic">du&#7779;k&#7771;tina&#7717;,</span> which indicates that they are always engaged in sinful activity. One who is liberated in this life does not commit any sinful activities. Sinful activity involves illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Another symptom of a liberated person is <span class="Italic">vijara,</span> which indicates that he is not subjected to the miseries of old age. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">vim&#7771;tyu.</span> A liberated person prepares himself in such a way that he does not take on any more material bodies, which are destined to die. In other words. he does not fall down again to repeat birth and death. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">vi&#347;oka,</span> which indicates that he is callous to material distress and happiness. Another is <span class="Italic">vijighatsa,</span> which indicates that he no longer desires material enjoyment. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">apip&#257;t&#257;,</span> which means that he has no desire other than to engage in the devotional service of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, his dearmost pursuable Lord. A further symptom is <span class="Italic">satya-k&#257;ma,</span> which indicates that all his desires are directed to the Supreme Truth, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He does not want anything else. He is <span class="Italic">satya-sa&#7749;kalpa.</span> Whatever he desires is fulfilled by the grace of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. First of all, he does not desire anything for his material benefit, and secondly if he desires anything at all, he simply desires to serve the Supreme Lord. That desire is fulfilled by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. That is called <span class="Italic">satya-sa&#7749;kalpa.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; points out that the word <span class="Italic">mahim&#257;</span> means returning to the spiritual world, back home, back to Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;ha. &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva says that the word <span class="Italic">mahim&#257;</span> means that the devotee attains the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called <span class="Italic">sadharma,</span> or &ldquo;the same quality.&rdquo; Just as K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is never born and never dies, His devotees who return to Godhead never die and never take birth within the material world.</div>

<div class="Translation">After N&#257;bhi Mah&#257;r&#257;ja departed for Badarik&#257;&#347;rama, the Supreme Lord, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, understood that His kingdom was His field of activities. He therefore showed Himself as an example and taught the duties of a householder by first accepting brahmacarya under the direction of spiritual masters. He also went to live at the spiritual masters&rsquo; place, gurukula. After His education was finished, He gave gifts (guru-dak&#7779;i&#7751;&#257;) to His spiritual masters and then accepted the life of a householder.

<div class="Translation">Being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva was fully independent because His form was spiritual, eternal and full of transcendental bliss. He eternally had nothing to do with the four principles of material misery [birth, death, old age and disease]. Nor was He materially attached. He was always equipoised, and He saw everyone on the same level. He was unhappy to see others unhappy, and He was the well-wisher of all living entities. Although He was a perfect personality, the Supreme Lord and controller of all, He nonetheless acted as if He were an ordinary conditioned soul. Therefore He strictly followed the principles of var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma and acted accordingly. In due course of time, the principles of var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma had become neglected; therefore through His personal characteristics and behavior, He taught the ignorant public how to perform duties within the var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma. In this way He regulated the general populace in householder life, enabling them to develop religion and economic well-being and to attain reputations, sons and daughters, material pleasure and finally eternal life. By His instructions, He showed how people could remain householders and at the same time become perfect by following the principles of var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma.<span class="Italic"></span></div>

<div class="Translation">Once while touring the world, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva, the Supreme Lord, reached a place known as Brahm&#257;varta. There was a great conference of learned br&#257;hma&#7751;as at that place, and all the King&rsquo;s sons attentively heard the instructions of the br&#257;hma&#7751;as there. At that assembly, within the hearing of the citizens, &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva instructed His sons, although they were already very well behaved, devoted and qualified. He instructed them so that in the future they could rule the world very perfectly. Thus he spoke as follows.</div>

<div class="First">The instructions of Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva to His sons are very valuable if one wants to live peacefully within this world, which is full of miseries. In the next chapter, Lord &#7770;&#7779;abhadeva gives His sons these valuable instructions.</div>
