<div style=" text-align : left"><div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter the <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> Ja&#7693;a Bharata instructs Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;ga&#7751;a in detail. He tells the King: &ldquo;You are not very experienced, yet you pose yourself as a learned person because you are very proud of your knowledge. Actually a person who is on the transcendental platform does not care for social behavior that sacrifices spiritual advancement. Social behavior comes within the jurisdiction of <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> material benefit. No one can spiritually advance by such activities. The conditioned soul is always overpowered by the modes of material nature. and consequently he is simply concerned with material benefits and auspicious and inauspicious material things. In other words, the mind, which is the leader of the senses, is absorbed in material activities life after life. Thus he continuously gets different types of bodies and suffers miserable material conditions. On the basis of mental concoction, social behavior has been formulated. If one&rsquo;s mind is absorbed in these activities, he certainly remains conditioned within the material world. According to different opinions, there are eleven or twelve mental activities, which can be transformed into hundreds and thousands. A person who is not K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious is subjected to all these mental concoctions and is thus governed by the material energy. The living entity who is free from mental concoctions attains the platform of pure spirit soul, devoid of material contamination. There are two types of living entities&mdash;<span class="Italic">j&#299;v&#257;tm&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">Param&#257;tm&#257;,</span> the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. That Supreme Soul in His ultimate realization is Lord V&#257;sudeva, K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. He enters into everyone&rsquo;s heart and controls the living entity in his different activities. He is therefore the supreme shelter of all living entities. One can understand the Supreme Soul and one&rsquo;s position in relationship with Him when one is completely freed from the unwanted association of ordinary men. In this way one can become fit to cross the ocean of nescience. The cause of conditional Life is attachment to the external energy. One has to conquer these mental concoctions: unless one does so, he will never be freed from material anxieties. Although mental concoctions have no value, their influence is still very formidable. No one should neglect to control the mind. If one does, the mind becomes so powerful that one immediately forgets his real position. Forgetting that he is an eternal servant of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and that service to K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is his only business, one is doomed by material nature to serve the objects of the senses. One should kill mental concoctions by the sword of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee [<span class="Italic">guru-k&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-pras&#257;de p&#257;ya bhakti-lat&#257;-b&#299;ja</span>]&rdquo;</div>

<div class="Translation">The br&#257;hma&#7751;a Ja&#7693;a Bharata said: My dear King, although you are not at all experienced, you are trying to speak like a very experienced man. Consequently you cannot be considered an experienced person. An experienced person does not speak the way you are speaking about the relationship between a master and a servant or about material pains and pleasures. These are simply external activities. Any advanced, experienced man, considering the Absolute Truth, does not talk in this way.</div>

Consequently their words cannot be given any importance. One has to learn from K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a or His devotee. If one speaks on the basis of this experience&mdash;that is, on the basis of spiritual knowledge&mdash;one&rsquo;s words are valuable. At the present moment, the entire world is full of foolish people. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> describes these people as <span class="Italic">m&#363;&#7693;has.</span> They are trying to rule human society, but because they are devoid of spiritual knowledge, the entire world is in a chaotic condition. To be released from these miserable conditions, one has to become K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a conscious and take lessons from an exalted personality like Ja&#7693;a Bharata, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Kapiladeva. That is the only way to solve the problems of material life.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">&ldquo;Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power and so forth.

<div class="Purport">The <span class="Italic">veda-v&#257;da</span> followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are generally inclined to <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> the performance of sacrifice according to the Vedic injunctions. They are thereby promoted to higher planetary systems. They generally practice the C&#257;turm&#257;sya system. <span class="Italic">Ak&#7779;ayya&#7745; ha vai c&#257;turm&#257;sya-y&#257;jina&#7717; suk&#7771;ta&#7745; bhavati:</span> one who performs the <span class="Italic">c&#257;turm&#257;sya-yaj�a</span> becomes pious. By becoming pious, one may be promoted to the higher planetary systems (<span class="Italic">&#363;rdhva&#7745; gacchanti sattva-sth&#257;&#7717;</span>). Some of the followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are attached to <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> the fruitive activities of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> in order to be promoted to a higher standard of life. Others argue that this is not the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Tad yathaiveha karma jita&#7717; loka&#7717; k&#7779;&#299;yate evam evam utra pu&#7751;ya jita&#7717; loka&#7717; k&#7779;&#299;yate.</span> In this world someone may become very highly elevated by taking birth in an aristocratic family, by being well educated, beautiful or very rich. These are the gifts for pious activities enacted in the past life. However, these will be finished when the stock of pious activity is finished. If we become attached to pious activities, we may get these various worldly facilities in the next life and may take birth in the heavenly planets. But all this will eventually be finished. <span class="Italic">K&#7779;&#299;&#7751;e pu&#7751;ye martya-loka&#7745; vi&#347;anti</span> (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/9/21?d=1">9.21</a>): when the stock of pious activity is finished, one again has to come to this <span class="Italic">martya-loka.</span> According to the Vedic injunctions, the performance of pious activity is not really the objective of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The objective of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> <span class="Italic">Vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedya&#7717;:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/15/15?d=1">15.15</a>] the objective of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to understand K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are <span class="Italic">veda-v&#257;d&#299;s</span> are not actually advanced in knowledge, and those who are followers of <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> (Brahman understanding) are also not perfect. However, when one comes to the platform of <span class="Italic">up&#257;san&#257;</span> and accepts the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes perfect (<span class="Italic">&#257;r&#257;dhan&#257;n&#257;&#7745; sarve&#7779;&#257;&#7745; vi&#7779;&#7751;or &#257;r&#257;dhana&#7745; param</span>). In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> the worship of different demigods and the performance of sacrifice are certainly, mentioned, but such worship is inferior because the worshipers do not know that the ultimate goal is Vi&#7779;&#7751;u (<span class="Italic">na te vidu&#7717; sv&#257;rtha-gati&#7745; hi vi&#7779;&#7751;um</I> [SB </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/7/5/31?d=1">7.5.31</a>]). When one comes to the platform of <span class="Italic">vi&#7779;&#7751;or &#257;r&#257;dhanam,</span> or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one has attained the perfection of life. Otherwise, as indicated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> one is not a <span class="Italic">tattva-v&#257;d&#299;</span> but a <span class="Italic">veda-v&#257;d&#299;, a</span> blind follower of the Vedic injunctions. A <span class="Italic">veda-v&#257;d&#299;</span> cannot be purified from material contamination unless he becomes a <span class="Italic">tattva-v&#257;d&#299;,</span> that is, one who knows <span class="Italic">tattva,</span> the Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Tattva</span> is also experienced in three features&mdash;<span class="Italic">brahmeti param&#257;tmeti bhagav&#257;n iti &#347;abdyate.</span> Even after coming to the platform of understanding <span class="Italic">tattva,</span> one must worship Bhagav&#257;n, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and His expansions, or one is not yet perfect. <span class="Italic">Bah&#363;n&#257;&#7745; janman&#257;m ante j�&#257;nav&#257;n m&#257;&#7745; prapadyate:</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/19?d=1">7.19</a>] after many births, one who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The conclusion is that unintelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand Bhagav&#257;n, Brahman or Param&#257;tm&#257;, but after studying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and attaining the understanding of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is supposed to be on the platform of perfect knowledge.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/2/45?d=1">2.45</a>), K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a advised Arjuna to become transcendental to the material activities impelled by the three material modes of nature (<span class="Italic">traigu&#7751;ya-vi&#7779;ay&#257; ved&#257; nistraigu&#7751;yo bhav&#257;rjuna</span>). The purpose of Vedic study is to transcend the activities of the three modes of material nature. Of course in the material world the mode of goodness is accepted as the best, and one can be promoted to the higher planetary systems by being on the <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> platform. However, that is not perfection. One must come to the conclusion that even the <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a</span> platform is also not good. One may dream that he has become a king with a good family, wife and children, but immediately at the end of that dream he comes to the conclusion that it is false. Similarly, all kinds of material happiness are undesirable for a person who wants spiritual salvation. If a person does not come to the conclusion that he has nothing to do with any kind of material happiness, he cannot come to the platform of understanding the Absolute Truth, or <span class="Italic">tattva j�&#257;na.</span> <span class="Italic">Karm&#299;s, j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are after some material elevation. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> work hard day and night for some bodily comfort, and the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s</span> simply speculate about how to get out of the entanglement of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and merge into the Brahman effulgence. The <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are very much addicted to the acquisition of material perfection and magical powers. All of them are trying to be materially perfect, but a devotee very easily comes to the platform of <span class="Italic">nirgu&#7751;a</span> in devotional service, and consequently for the devotee the results of <span class="Italic">karma, j�&#257;na and yoga</span> become very insignificant. Therefore only the devotee is on the platform of <span class="Italic">tattva j�&#257;na,</span> not the others. Of course the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s</span> position is better than that of the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;</span> but that position is also insufficient. The <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299; must</span> actually become liberated, and after liberation he may be situated in devotional service (<span class="Italic">mad-bhakti&#7745; labhate par&#257;m</I> [Bg. </I></span><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/54?d=1">18.54</a>]).</div>

<div class="Translation">As long as the mind of the living entity is contaminated by the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), his mind is exactly like an independent, uncontrolled elephant. It simply expands its jurisdiction of pious and impious activities by using the senses. The result is that the living entity remains in the material world to enjoy and suffer pleasures and pains due to material activity.</div>

<div class="First">In <span class="Italic">Caitanya-carit&#257;m&#7771;ta</span> it is said that material pious and impious activities are both opposed to the principle of devotional service.

If the mind is captivated by the pious and impious activities mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> one remains eternally in darkness; one cannot attain the absolute platform. To change the consciousness from ignorance to passion or from passion to goodness does not really solve the problem.

<div class="Translation">Because the mind is absorbed in desires for pious and impious activities, it is naturally subjected to the transformations of lust and anger. In this way, it becomes attracted to material sense enjoyment. In other words, the mind is conducted by the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. There are eleven senses and five material elements, and out of these sixteen items, the mind is the chief. Therefore the mind brings about birth in different types of bodies among demigods, human beings, animals and birds. When the mind is situated in a higher or lower position, it accepts a higher or lower material body.</div>

<div class="Translation">There are two kinds of k&#7779;etraj�a&mdash;the living entity, as explained above, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is explained as follows. He is the all-pervading cause of creation. He is full in Himself and is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does not experience birth, death, old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with Lord Brahm&#257;. He is called N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, and He is the shelter of living entities after the annihilation of this material world. He is full of all opulences, and He is the resting place of everything material. He is therefore known as V&#257;sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His own potency, He is present within the hearts of all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of all beings, moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. In His partial feature, the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters all bodies and controls them.</div>

<div class="First">There is one easy weapon with which the mind can be conquered&mdash;neglect. The mind is always telling us to do this or that; therefore we should be very expert in disobeying the mind&rsquo;s orders. Gradually the mind should be trained to obey the orders of the soul. It is not that one should obey the orders of the mind. &#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura used to say that to control the mind one should beat it with shoes many times just after awakening and again before going to sleep. In this way one can control the mind. This is the instruction of all the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;stras.</span> If one does not do so, one is doomed to follow the dictations of the mind. Another bona fide process is to abide strictly by the orders of the spiritual master and engage in the Lord&rsquo;s service. Then the mind will be automatically controlled. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has instructed &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299;:</div>
