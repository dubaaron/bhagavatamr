When he went away to take up the renounced order of life [sanny&#257;sa], leaving home without undergoing reformation by the sacred thread or the ceremonies observed by the higher castes, his father, Vy&#257;sadeva, fearing separation from him, cried out, "O my son!"

<div class="First">The institution of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;a</span> and <span class="Italic">&#257;&#347;rama</span> prescribes many regulative duties to be observed by its followers. Such duties enjoin that a candidate willing to study the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> must approach a bona fide spiritual master and request acceptance as his disciple. The sacred thread is the sign of those who are competent to study the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> from the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya,</span> or the bona fide spiritual master. &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; did not undergo such purificatory ceremonies because he was a liberated soul from his very birth.</div>
<A NAME="11439"></A><div id="11439"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Generally, a man is born as an ordinary being, and by the purificatory processes he is born for the second time. When he sees a new light and seeks direction for spiritual progress, he approaches a spiritual master for instruction in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> The spiritual master accepts only the sincere inquirer as his disciple and gives him the sacred thread. In this way a man becomes twice-born, or a <span class="Italic">dvija.</span> After qualifying as a <span class="Italic">dvija</span> one may study the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and after becoming well versed in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> one becomes a <span class="Italic">vipra.</span> A <span class="Italic">vipra,</span> or a qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> thus realizes the Absolute and makes further progress in spiritual life until he reaches the Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava stage. The Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava stage is the postgraduate status of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> A progressive <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> must necessarily become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, for a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is a self-realized, learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span></div>
<A NAME="11440"></A><div id="11440"> </div>
<div class="Purport">&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava from the beginning; therefore, there was no need for him to undergo all the processes of the <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama</span> institution. Ultimately the aim of <span class="Italic">var&#7751;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma</span> is to turn a crude man into a pure devotee of the Lord, or a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava. Anyone, therefore, who becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava accepted by the first-class Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, or <span class="Italic">uttama-adhik&#257;r&#299;</span> Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, is already considered a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a,</span> regardless of his birth or past deeds. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu accepted this principle and recognized &#346;r&#299;la Harid&#257;sa &#7788;h&#257;kura as the <span class="Italic">&#257;c&#257;rya</span> of the holy name, although &#7788;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa appeared in a Mohammedan family. In conclusion, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was born a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, and, therefore, brahminism was included in him. He did not have to undergo any ceremonies. Any lowborn person-be he a Kir&#257;ta, H&#363;&#7751;a, &#256;ndhra, Pulinda, Pulka&#347;a, &#256;bh&#299;ra, &#346;umbha, Yavana, Khasa or even lower-can be delivered to the highest transcendental position by the mercy of Vai&#7779;&#7751;avas. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was the spiritual master of &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; before he begins his answers to the questions of the sages at Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya.</div>

<A NAME="11455"></A><div id="11455"> </div>
<div class="Purport">There is no point in arguing that a materialistic man can be happy. No materialistic creature-be he the great Brahm&#257; or an insignificant ant-can be happy. Everyone tries to make a permanent plan for happiness, but everyone is baffled by the laws of material nature. Therefore the materialistic world is called the darkest region of God's creation. Yet the unhappy materialists can get out of it simply by desiring to get out. Unfortunately they are so foolish that they do not want to escape. Therefore they are compared to the camel who relishes thorny twigs because he likes the taste of the twigs mixed with blood. He does not realize that it is his own blood and that his tongue is being cut by the thorns. Similarly, to the materialist his own blood is as sweet as honey, and although he is always harassed by his own material creations, he does not wish to escape. Such materialists are called <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s.</span> Out of hundreds of thousands of <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> only a few may feel tired of material engagement and desire to get out of the labyrinth. Such intelligent persons are called <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s.</span> The <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> is directed to such <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s.</span> But &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, being the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, could foresee the misuse of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> by unscrupulous men, and, therefore, he personally supplemented the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> with the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a.</span> It is clearly said that this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the original commentary on the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras.</span> &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva also instructed the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> to his own son, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who was already at the liberated stage of transcendence. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva realized it personally and then explained it. By the mercy of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva, the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> is available for all those sincere souls who want to get out of material existence.</div>
<A NAME="11456"></A><div id="11456"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the one unrivaled commentary on <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra.</span> &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya intentionally did not touch it because he knew that the natural commentary would be difficult for him to surpass. He wrote his <span class="Italic">&#346;&#257;r&#299;raka-bh&#257;&#7779;ya,</span> and his so-called followers deprecated the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as some "new" presentation. One should not be misled by such propaganda directed against the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da school. From this introductory <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> the beginning student should know that <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the only transcendental literature meant for those who are <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas</span> and completely freed from the material disease called malice. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s are envious of the Personality of Godhead despite &#346;r&#299;p&#257;da &#346;a&#7749;kar&#257;c&#257;rya's admission that N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, is above the material creation. The envious M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; cannot have access to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> but those who are really anxious to get out of this material existence may take shelter of this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> because it is uttered by the liberated &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. It is the transcendental torchlight by which one can see perfectly the transcendental Absolute Truth realized as Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n.</div>

His struggle for existence in the material world is perpetual, and it is not possible for him to get out of it by making plans. If he at all wants to conquer this perpetual struggle for existence, he must reestablish his eternal relation with God.

<div class="First">In this statement, &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; answers the first question of the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya. The sages asked him to summarize the whole range of revealed scriptures and present the most essential part so that fallen people or the people in general might easily take it up. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> prescribe two different types of occupation for the human being. One is called the <span class="Italic">prav&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga,</span> or the path of sense enjoyment, and the other is called the <span class="Italic">niv&#7771;tti-m&#257;rga,</span> or the path of renunciation. The path of enjoyment is inferior, and the path of sacrifice for the supreme cause is superior. The material existence of the living being is a diseased condition of actual life. Actual life is spiritual existence, or <span class="Italic">brahma-bh&#363;ta </I>[</I>SB <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/4/30/20?d=1">4.30.20</a></I>]</span></I> existence, where life is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Material existence is temporary, illusory and full of miseries. There is no happiness at all. There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries, and temporary cessation of misery is falsely called happiness. Therefore, the path of progressive material enjoyment, which is temporary, miserable and illusory, is inferior. But devotional service to the Supreme Lord, which leads one to eternal, blissful and all-cognizant life, is called the superior quality of occupation. This is sometimes polluted when mixed with the inferior quality. For example, adoption of devotional service for material gain is certainly an obstruction to the progressive path of renunciation. Renunciation or abnegation for ultimate good is certainly a better occupation than enjoyment in the diseased condition of life. Such enjoyment only aggravates the symptoms of disease and increases its duration. Therefore devotional service to the Lord must be pure in quality, i.e., without the least desire for material enjoyment. One should, therefore, accept the superior quality of occupation in the form of the devotional service of the Lord without any tinge of unnecessary desire, fruitive action and philosophical speculation. This alone can lead one to perpetual solace in His service.</div>
<A NAME="11501"></A><div id="11501"> </div>
<div class="Purport">We have purposely denoted <span class="Italic">dharma</span> as occupation because the root meaning of the word <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is "that which sustains one's existence." A living being's sustenance of existence is to coordinate his activities with his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the central pivot of living beings, and He is the all-attractive living entity or eternal form amongst all other living beings or eternal forms. Each and every living being has his eternal form in the spiritual existence, and K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the eternal attraction for all of them. K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the complete whole, and everything else is His part and parcel. The relation is one of the servant and the served. It is transcendental and is completely distinct from our experience in material existence. This relation of servant and the served is the most congenial form of intimacy. One can realize it as devotional service progresses. Everyone should engage himself in that transcendental loving service of the Lord, even in the present conditional state of material existence. That will gradually give one the clue to actual life and please him to complete satisfaction.</div>

<div class="First">Those who consider devotional service to the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a to be something like material emotional affairs may argue that in the revealed scriptures, sacrifice, charity, austerity, knowledge, mystic powers and similar other processes of transcendental realization are recommended. According to them, <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> or the devotional service of the Lord, is meant for those who cannot perform the high-grade activities. Generally it is said that the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult is meant for the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras, vai&#347;yas</span> and the less intelligent woman class. But that is not the actual fact. The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult is the topmost of all transcendental activities, and therefore it is simultaneously sublime and easy. It is sublime for the pure devotees who are serious about getting in contact with the Supreme Lord, and it is easy for the neophytes who are just on the threshold of the house of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> To achieve the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is a great science, and it is open for all living beings, including the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras, vai&#347;yas,</span> women and even those lower than the lowborn <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras,</span> so what to speak of the high-class men like the qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and the great self-realized kings. The other high-grade activities designated as sacrifice, charity, austerity, etc., are all corollary factors following the pure and scientific <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult.</div>
<A NAME="11516"></A><div id="11516"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The principles of knowledge and detachment are two important factors on the path of transcendental realization. The whole spiritual process leads to perfect knowledge of everything material and spiritual, and the results of such perfect knowledge are that one becomes detached from material affection and becomes attached to spiritual activities. Becoming detached from material things does not mean becoming inert altogether, as men with a poor fund of knowledge think. <span class="Italic">Nai&#7779;karma</span> means not undertaking activities that will produce good or bad effects. Negation does not mean negation of the positive. Negation of the nonessentials does not meant negation of the essential. Similarly, detachment from material forms does not mean nullifying the positive form. The <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult is meant for realization of the positive form. When the positive form is realized, the negative forms are automatically eliminated. Therefore, with the development of the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, with the application of positive service to the positive form, one naturally becomes detached from inferior things, and he becomes attached to superior things. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, being the supermost occupation of the living being, leads him out of material sense enjoyment. That is the sign of a pure devotee. He is not a fool, nor is he engaged in the inferior energies, nor does he have material values. This is not possible by dry reasoning. It actually happens by the grace of the Almighty. In conclusion, one who is a pure devotee has all other good qualities, namely knowledge, detachment, etc., but one who has only knowledge or detachment is not necessarily well acquainted with the principles of the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is the supermost occupation of the human being.</div>

<div class="First">There are different occupational activities in terms of man's different conceptions of life. To the gross materialist who cannot see anything beyond the gross material body, there is nothing beyond the senses. Therefore his occupational activities are limited to concentrated and extended selfishness. Concentrated selfishness centers around the personal body-this is generally seen amongst the lower animals. Extended selfishness is manifested in human society and centers around the family, society, community, nation and world with a view to gross bodily comfort. Above these gross materialists are the mental speculators who hover aloft in the mental spheres, and their occupational duties involve making poetry and philosophy or propagating some <span class="Italic">ism</span> with the same aim of selfishness limited to the body and the mind. But above the body and mind is the dormant spirit soul whose absence from the body makes the whole range of bodily and mental selfishness completely null and void. But less intelligent people have no information of the needs of the spirit soul.</div>
<A NAME="11531"></A><div id="11531"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Because foolish people have no information of the soul and how it is beyond the purview of the body and mind, they are not satisfied in the performance of their occupational duties. The question of the satisfaction of the self is raised herein. The self is beyond the gross body and subtle mind. He is the potent active principle of the body and mind. Without knowing the need of the dormant soul, one cannot be happy simply with emolument of the body and mind. The body and the mind are but superfluous outer coverings of the spirit soul. The spirit soul's needs must be fulfilled. Simply by cleansing the cage of the bird, one does not satisfy the bird. One must actually know the needs of the bird himself.</div>
<A NAME="11532"></A><div id="11532"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The need of the spirit soul is that he wants to get out of the limited sphere of material bondage and fulfill his desire for complete freedom. He wants to get out of the covered walls of the greater universe. He wants to see the free light and the spirit. That complete freedom is achieved when he meets the complete spirit, the Personality of Godhead. There is a dormant affection for God within everyone; spiritual existence is manifested through the gross body and mind in the form of perverted affection for gross and subtle matter. Therefore we have to engage ourselves in occupational engagements that will evoke our divine consciousness. This is possible only by hearing and chanting the divine activities of the Supreme Lord, and any occupational activity which does not help one to achieve attachment for hearing and chanting the transcendental message of Godhead is said herein to be simply a waste of time. This is because other occupational duties (whatever <span class="Italic">ism</span> they may belong to) cannot give liberation to the soul. Even the activities of the salvationists are considered to be useless because of their failure to pick up the fountainhead of all liberties. The gross materialist can practically see that his material gain is limited only to time and space, either in this world or in the other. Even if he goes up to the Svargaloka, he will find no permanent abode for his hankering soul. The hankering soul must be satisfied by the perfect scientific process of perfect devotional service.</div>

<div class="First">We have already discussed that pure devotional service to the Lord is automatically followed by perfect knowledge and detachment from material existence. But there are others who consider that all kinds of different occupational engagements, including those of religion, are meant for material gain. The general tendency of any ordinary man in any part of the world is to gain some material profit in exchange for religious or any other occupational service. Even in the Vedic literatures, for all sorts of religious performances an allurement of material gain is offered, and most people are attracted by such allurements or blessings of religiosity. Why are such so-called men of religion allured by material gain? Because material gain can enable one to fulfill desires, which in turn satisfy sense gratification. This cycle of occupational engagements includes so-called religiosity followed by material gain and material gain followed by fulfillment of desires. Sense gratification is the general way for all sorts of fully occupied men. But in the statement of S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, as per the verdict of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> this is nullified by the present <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span></div>

<div class="First">The completely bewildered material civilization is wrongly directed towards the fulfillment of desires in sense gratification. In such civilization, in all spheres of life, the ultimate end is sense gratification. In politics, social service, altruism, philanthropy and ultimately in religion or even in salvation, the very same tint of sense gratification is ever-increasingly predominant. In the political field the leaders of men fight with one another to fulfill their personal sense gratification. The voters adore the so-called leaders only when they promise sense gratification. As soon as the voters are dissatisfied in their own sense satisfaction, they dethrone the leaders, The leaders must always disappoint the voters by not satisfying their senses. The same is applicable in all other fields; no one is serious about the problems of life. Even those who are on the path of salvation desire to become one with the Absolute Truth and desire to commit spiritual suicide for sense gratification. But the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> says that one should not live for sense gratification. One should satisfy the senses only insomuch as required for self-preservation, and not for sense gratification. Because the body is made of senses, which also require a certain amount of satisfaction, there are regulative directions for satisfaction of such senses. But the senses are not meant for unrestricted enjoyment. For example, marriage or the combination of a man with a woman is necessary for progeny, but it is not meant for sense enjoyment. In the absence of voluntary restraint, there is propaganda for family planning, but foolish men do not know that family planning is automatically executed as soon as there is search after the Absolute Truth. Seekers of the Absolute Truth are never allured by unnecessary engagements in sense gratification because the serious students seeking the Absolute Truth are always overwhelmed with the work of researching the Truth. In every sphere of life, therefore, the ultimate end must be seeking after the Absolute Truth, and that sort of engagement will make one happy because he will be less engaged in varieties of sense gratification. And what that Absolute Truth is is explained as follows.</div>

<div class="First">The Absolute Truth is both subject and object, and there is no qualitative difference there. Therefore, Brahman, Param&#257;tm&#257; and Bhagav&#257;n are qualitatively one and the same. The same substance is realized as impersonal Brahman by the students of the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads,</span> as localized Param&#257;tm&#257; by the Hira&#7751;yagarbhas or the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s,</span> and as Bhagav&#257;n by the devotees. In other words, Bhagav&#257;n, or the Personality of Godhead, is the last word of the Absolute Truth. Param&#257;tm&#257; is the partial representation of the Personality of Godhead, and impersonal Brahman is the glowing effulgence of the Personality of Godhead, as the sun rays are to the sun-god. Less intelligent students of either of the above schools sometimes argue in favor of their own respective realization, but those who are perfect seers of the Absolute Truth know well that the above three features of the one Absolute Truth are different perspective views seen from different angles of vision.</div>

In the relative world the knower is different from the known, but in the Absolute Truth both the knower and the known are one and the same thing. In the relative world the knower is the living spirit or superior energy, whereas the known is inert matter or inferior energy. Therefore, there is a duality of inferior and superior energy, whereas in the absolute realm both the knower and the known are of the same superior energy. There are three kinds of energies of the supreme energetic. There is no difference between the energy and energetic, but there is a difference of quality of energies. The absolute realm and the living entities are of the same superior energy, but the material world is inferior energy. The living being in contact with the inferior energy is illusioned, thinking he belongs to the inferior energy. Therefore there is the sense of relativity in the material world. In the Absolute there is no such sense of difference between the knower and the known, and therefore everything there is absolute.</div>

<div class="First">The Absolute Truth is realized in full by the process of devotional service to the Lord, V&#257;sudeva, or the Personality of Godhead, who is the full-fledged Absolute Truth. Brahman is His transcendental bodily effulgence, and Param&#257;tm&#257; is His partial representation. As such, Brahman or Param&#257;tm&#257; realization of the Absolute Truth is but a partial realization. There are four different types of human beings-the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> the <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;n&#299;s,</span> the <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> and the devotees. The <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> are materialistic, whereas the other three are transcendental. The first-class transcendentalists are the devotees who have realized the Supreme Person. The second-class transcendentalists are those who have partially realized the plenary portion of the absolute person. And the third-class transcendentalists are those who have barely realized the spiritual focus of the absolute person. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and other Vedic literatures, the Supreme Person is realized by devotional service, which is backed by full knowledge and detachment from material association. We have already discussed the point that devotional service is followed by knowledge and detachment from material association. As Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257; realization are imperfect realizations of the Absolute Truth, so the means of realizing Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257;, i.e., the paths of <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;na</span> and <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> are also imperfect means of realizing the Absolute Truth. Devotional service, which is based on the foreground of full knowledge combined with detachment from material association and which is fixed by the aural reception of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-&#347;ruti,</span> is the only perfect method by which the seriously inquisitive student can realize the Absolute Truth. Devotional service is not, therefore, meant for the less intelligent class of transcendentalist. There are three classes of devotees, namely first, second, and third class. The third-class devotees, or the neophytes, who have no knowledge and are not detached from material association, but who are simply attracted by the preliminary process of worshiping the Deity in the temple, are called material devotees. Material devotees are more attached to material benefit than transcendental profit. Therefore, one has to make definite progress from the position of material devotional service to the second-class devotional position. In the second-class position, the devotee can see four principles in the devotional line, namely the Personality of Godhead, His devotees, the ignorant and the envious. One has to raise himself at least to the stage of a second-class devotee and thus become eligible to know the Absolute Truth.</div>
<A NAME="11591"></A><div id="11591"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A third-class devotee, therefore, has to receive the instructions of devotional service from the authoritative sources of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata.</span> The number one <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> is the established personality of devotee, and the other <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the message of Godhead. The third-class devotee therefore has to go to the personality of devotee in order to learn the instructions of devotional service. Such a personality of devotee is not a professional man who earns his livelihood by the business of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Such a devotee must be a representative of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, like S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and must preach the cult of devotional service for the all-around benefit of all people. A neophyte devotee has very little taste for hearing from the authorities. Such a neophyte devotee makes a show of hearing from the professional man to satisfy his senses. This sort of hearing and chanting has spoiled the whole thing, so one should be very careful about the faulty process. The holy messages of Godhead, as inculcated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or in the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> are undoubtedly transcendental subjects, but even though they are so, such transcendental matters are not to be received from the professional man, who spoils them as the serpent spoils milk simply by the touch of his tongue.</div>
<A NAME="11592"></A><div id="11592"> </div>
<div class="Purport">A sincere devotee must, therefore, be prepared to hear the Vedic literature like the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads, Ved&#257;nta</span> and other literatures left by the previous authorities or Gosv&#257;m&#299;s, for the benefit of his progress. Without hearing such literatures, one cannot make actual progress. And without hearing and following the instructions, the show of devotional service becomes worthless and therefore a sort of disturbance in the path of devotional service. Unless, therefore, devotional service is established on the principles of <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti, sm&#7771;ti, pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> or <span class="Italic">pa&#241;car&#257;tra</span> authorities, the make-show of devotional service should at once be rejected. An unauthorized devotee should never be recognized as a pure devotee. By assimilation of such messages from the Vedic literatures, one can see the all-pervading localized aspect of the Personality of Godhead within his own self constantly. This is called <span class="Italic">sam&#257;dhi.</span></div>

<div class="First">If realization of the Absolute Truth is the ultimate aim of life, it must be carried out by all means. In any one of the above-mentioned castes and orders of life, the four processes, namely glorifying, hearing, remembering and worshiping, are general occupations. Without these principles of life, no one can exist. Activities of the living being involve engagements in these four different principles of life. Especially in modern society, all activities are more or less dependent on hearing and glorifying. Any man from any social status becomes a well-known man in human society within a very short time if he is simply glorified truly or falsely in the daily newspapers. Sometimes political leaders of a particular party are also advertised by newspaper propaganda, and by such a method of glorification an insignificant man becomes an important man-within no time. But such propaganda by false glorification of an unqualified person cannot bring about any good, either for the particular man or for the society. There may be some temporary reactions to such propaganda, but there are no permanent effects. Therefore such activities are a waste of time. The actual object of glorification is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created everything manifested before us. We have broadly discussed this fact from the beginning of the "<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya</span>"<span class="Italic"></I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I> <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> of this <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> The tendency to glorify others or hear others must be turned to the real object of glorification-the Supreme Being. And that will bring happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation">With sword in hand, intelligent men cut through the binding knots of reactionary work [karma] by remembering the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, who will not pay attention to His message?</div>

<div class="First">The contact of the spiritual spark with material elements creates a knot which must be cut if one wants to be liberated from the actions and reactions of fruitive work. Liberation means freedom from the cycle of reactionary work. This liberation automatically follows for one who constantly remembers the transcendental pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. This is because all the activities of the Supreme Lord (His <span class="Italic">l&#299;l&#257;</span>) are transcendental to the modes of the material energy. They are all-attractive spiritual activities, and therefore constant association with the spiritual activities of the Supreme Lord gradually spiritualizes the conditioned soul and ultimately severs the knot of material bondage.</div>
<A NAME="11636"></A><div id="11636"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Liberation from material bondage is, therefore, a by-product of devotional service. Attainment of spiritual knowledge is not sufficient to insure liberation. Such knowledge must be overcoated with devotional service so that ultimately the devotional service alone predominates. Then liberation is made possible. Even the reactionary work of the fruitive workers can lead one to liberation when it is overcoated with devotional service. <span class="Italic">Karma</span> overcoated with devotional service is called <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> Similarly, empirical knowledge overcoated with devotional service is called <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;na-yoga.</span> But pure <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is independent of such <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">j&#241;&#257;na</span> because it alone can not only endow one with liberation from conditional life but also award one the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="11637"></A><div id="11637"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, any sensible man who is above the average man with a poor fund of knowledge must constantly remember the Personality of Godhead by hearing about Him, by glorifying Him, by remembering Him and by worshiping Him always, without cessation. That is the perfect way of devotional service. The Gosv&#257;m&#299;s of V&#7771;nd&#257;vana, who were authorized by &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu to preach the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult, rigidly followed this rule and made immense literatures of transcendental science for our benefit. They have chalked out ways for all classes of men in terms of the different castes and orders of life in pursuance of the teachings of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> and similar other authoritative scriptures.</div>

<div class="First">The conditioned life of a living being is caused by his revolting against the Lord. There are men called <span class="Italic">deva,</span> or godly living beings, and there are men called <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or demons, who are against the authority of the Supreme Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> (Sixteenth Chapter) a vivid description of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> is given in which it is said that the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are put into lower and lower states of ignorance life after life and so sink to the lower animal forms and have no information of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. These <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are gradually rectified to God consciousness by the mercy of the Lord's liberated servitors in different countries according to the supreme will. Such devotees of God are very confidential associates of the Lord, and when they come to save human society from the dangers of godlessness, they are known as the powerful incarnations of the Lord, as sons of the Lord, as servants of the Lord or as associates of the Lord. But none of them falsely claim to be God themselves. This is a blasphemy declared by the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> and the demoniac followers of such <span class="Italic">asuras</span> also accept pretenders as God or His incarnation. In the revealed scriptures there is definite information of the incarnation of God. No one should be accepted as God or an incarnation of God unless he is confirmed by the revealed scriptures.</div>
<A NAME="11652"></A><div id="11652"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The servants of God are to be respected as God by the devotees who actually want to go back to Godhead. Such servants of God are called <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or <span class="Italic">t&#299;rthas,</span> and they preach according to particular time and place. The servants of God urge people to become devotees of the Lord. They never tolerate being called God. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu was God Himself according to the indication of the revealed scriptures, but He played the part of a devotee. People who knew Him to be God addressed Him as God, but He used to block His ears with His hands and chant the name of Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. He strongly protested against being called God, although undoubtedly He was God Himself. The Lord behaves so to warn us against unscrupulous men who take pleasure in being addressed as God.</div>
<A NAME="11653"></A><div id="11653"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The servants of God come to propagate God consciousness, and intelligent people should cooperate with them in every respect. By serving the servant of God, one can please God more than by directly serving the Lord. The Lord is more pleased when He sees that His servants are properly respected because such servants risk everything for the service of the Lord and so are very dear to the Lord. The Lord declares in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/69?d=1">18.69</a>) that no one is dearer to Him than one who risks everything to preach His glory. By serving the servants of the Lord, one gradually gets the quality of such servants, and thus one becomes qualified to hear the glories of God. The eagerness to hear about God is the first qualification of a devotee eligible for entering the kingdom of God.</div>

There is no rigid fixture of time, and anyone can chant the holy name with attention and reverence at his convenience. The Lord is so kind to us that He can be present before us personally in the form of transcendental sound, but unfortunately we have no taste for hearing and glorifying the Lord's name and activities. We have already discussed developing a taste for hearing and chanting the holy sound. It is done through the medium of service to the pure devotee of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="11668"></A><div id="11668"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Lord is reciprocally respondent to His devotees. When He sees that a devotee is completely sincere in getting admittance to the transcendental service of the Lord and has thus become eager to hear about Him, the Lord acts from within the devotee in such a way that the devotee may easily go back to Him. The Lord is more anxious to take us back into His kingdom than we can desire. Most of us do not desire at all to go back to Godhead. Only a very few men want to go back to Godhead. But anyone who desires to go back to Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a helps in all respects.</div>
<A NAME="11669"></A><div id="11669"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless one is perfectly cleared of all sins. The material sins are products of our desires to lord it over material nature. It is very difficult to get rid of such desires. Women and wealth are very difficult problems for the devotee making progress on the path back to Godhead. Many stalwarts in the devotional line fell victim to these allurements and thus retreated from the path of liberation. But when one is helped by the Lord Himself, the whole process becomes as easy as anything by the divine grace of the Lord.</div>
<A NAME="11670"></A><div id="11670"> </div>
<div class="Purport">To become restless in the contact of women and wealth is not an astonishment, because every living being is associated with such things from remote time, practically immemorial, and it takes time to recover from this foreign nature. But if one is engaged in hearing the glories of the Lord, gradually he realizes his real position. By the grace of God such a devotee gets sufficient strength to defend himself from the state of disturbances, and gradually all disturbing elements are eliminated from his mind.</div>

And simply by associating with them and accepting the remnants of foodstuff left by the sages, the son of the maidservant got the chance to become the great devotee and personality &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;radadeva.

This self-satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the self-satisfied <span class="Italic">&#257;tm&#257;nand&#299;</span> is transcendental to the material state of existence. This stage of perfection is attained as soon as one is fixed in irrevocable devotional service. Devotional service is not inactivity, but the unalloyed activity of the soul.</div>

A devotee is always qualified with all the good qualities of God. Quantitatively such qualifications may be different, but qualitatively both the Lord and His devotee are one and the same.</div>

Mostly men are conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus they are engaged always in lust, desire, hankerings, ignorance and sleep. Out of many such manlike animals, there is actually a man who knows the responsibility of human life and thus tries to make life perfect by following the prescribed duties. And out of many thousands of such persons who have thus attained success in human life, one may know scientifically about the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In the same <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/18/55?d=1">18.55</a>) it is also said that scientific knowledge of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is understood only by the process of devotional service (<span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga).</span></div>
<A NAME="11716"></A><div id="11716"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The very same thing is confirmed herein in the above words. No ordinary man, or even one who has attained success in human life, can know scientifically or perfectly the Personality of Godhead. Perfection of human life is attained when one can understand that he is not the product of matter but is in fact spirit. And as soon as one understands that he has nothing to do with matter, he at once ceases his material hankerings and becomes enlivened as a spiritual being. This attainment of success is possible when one is above the modes of passion and ignorance, or, in other words, when one is actually a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by qualification. A <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is the symbol of <span class="Italic">sattva-gu&#7751;a,</span> or the mode of goodness. And others, who are not in the mode of goodness, are either <span class="Italic">k&#7779;atriyas, vai&#347;yas, &#347;&#363;dras</span> or less than the <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dras.</span> The brahminical stage is the highest stage of human life because of its good qualities. So one cannot be a devotee unless one at least qualifies as a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> The devotee is already a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> by action. But that is not the end of it. As referred to above, such a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> has to become a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava in fact to be actually in the transcendental stage. A pure Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava is a liberated soul and is transcendental even to the position of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> In the material stage even a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> is also a conditioned soul because although in the brahminical stage the conception of Brahman or transcendence is realized, scientific knowledge of the Supreme Lord is lacking. One has to surpass the brahminical stage and reach the <span class="Italic">vasudeva</span> stage to understand the Personality of Godhead K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The science of the Personality of Godhead is the subject matter for study by the postgraduate students in the spiritual line. Foolish men, or men with a poor fund of knowledge, do not understand the Supreme Lord, and they interpret K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a according to their respective whims. The fact is, however, that one cannot understand the science of the Personality of Godhead unless one is freed from the contamination of the material modes, even up to the stage of a <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a.</span> When a qualified <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span> factually becomes a Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava, in the enlivened state of liberation he can know what is actually the Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">Attaining scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead means seeing one's own self simultaneously. As far as the identity of the living being as spirit self is concerned, there are a number of speculations and misgivings. The materialist does not believe in the existence of the spirit self, and empiric philosophers believe in the impersonal feature of the whole spirit without individuality of the living beings. But the transcendentalists affirm that the soul and the Supersoul are two different identities, qualitatively one but quantitatively different. There are many other theories, but all these different speculations are at once cleared off as soon as &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is realized in truth by the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is like the sun, and the materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth are like the darkest midnight. As soon as the K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a sun is arisen within one's heart, the darkness of materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth and the living beings is at once cleared off. In the presence of the sun, the darkness cannot stand, and the relative truths that were hidden within the dense darkness of ignorance become clearly manifested by the mercy of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is residing in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.</div>
<A NAME="11731"></A><div id="11731"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/10/11?d=1">10.11</a>) the Lord says that in order to show special favor to His pure devotees, He personally eradicates the dense darkness of all misgivings by switching on the light of pure knowledge within the heart of a devotee. Therefore, because of the Personality of Godhead's taking charge of illuminating the heart of His devotee, certainly a devotee, engaged in His service in transcendental love, cannot remain in darkness. He comes to know everything of the absolute and the relative truths. The devotee cannot remain in darkness, and because a devotee is enlightened by the Personality of Godhead, his knowledge is certainly perfect. This is not the case for those who speculate on the Absolute Truth by dint of their own limited power of approach. Perfect knowledge is called <span class="Italic">parampar&#257;,</span> or deductive knowledge coming down from the authority to the submissive aural receiver who is bona fide by service and surrender. One cannot challenge the authority of the Supreme and know Him also at the same time. He reserves the right of not being exposed to such a challenging spirit of an insignificant spark of the whole, a spark subjected to the control of illusory energy. The devotees are submissive, and therefore the transcendental knowledge descends from the Personality of Godhead to Brahm&#257; and from Brahm&#257; to his sons and disciples in succession. This process is helped by the Supersoul within such devotees. That is the perfect way of learning transcendental knowledge.</div>
<A NAME="11732"></A><div id="11732"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This enlightenment perfectly enables the devotee to distinguish spirit from matter because the knot of spirit and matter is untied by the Lord. This knot is called <span class="Italic">aha&#7749;k&#257;ra,</span> and it falsely obliges a living being to become identified with matter. As soon as this knot is loosened, therefore, all the clouds of doubt are at once cleared off. One sees his master and fully engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, making a full termination of the chain of fruitive action. In material existence, a living being creates his own chain of fruitive work and enjoys the good and bad effects of those actions life after life. But as soon as he engages himself in the loving service of the Lord, he at once becomes free from the chain of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> His actions no longer create any reaction.</div>

The living entities are separated parts and parcels of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore Lord Sri K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original form of Godhead, and He is the last word in the Transcendence.

In forms of the Personality of Godhead other than &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Baladeva, there is no facility for intimate personal contact as in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord at Vrajabh&#363;mi.

Creation is made possible by the goodness of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and when it requires to be destroyed, Lord &#346;iva does it by the <span class="Italic">t&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avan&#7771;tya.</span> The materialists and the foolish human beings worship Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva respectively. But the pure transcendentalists worship the form of goodness, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, in His various forms. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is manifested by His millions and billions of integrated forms and separated forms. The integrated forms are called Godhead, and the separated forms are called the living entities or the <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas.</span> Both the <span class="Italic">j&#299;vas</span> and Godhead have their original spiritual forms. <span class="Italic">J&#299;vas</span> are sometimes subjected to the control of material energy, but the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u forms are always controllers of this energy. When Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead, appears in the material world, He comes to deliver the conditioned living beings who are under the material energy. Such living beings appear in the material world with intentions of being lords, and thus they become entrapped by the three modes of nature. As such, the living entities have to change their material coverings for undergoing different terms of imprisonment. The prison house of the material world is created by Brahm&#257; under instruction of the Personality of Godhead, and at the conclusion of a <span class="Italic">kalpa</span> the whole thing is destroyed by &#346;iva. But as far as maintenance of the prison house is concerned, it is done by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, as much as the state prison house is maintained by the state. Anyone, therefore, who wishes to get out of this prison house of material existence, which is full of miseries like repetition of birth, death, disease and old age, must please Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u for such liberation. Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is worshiped by devotional service only, and if anyone has to continue prison life in the material world, he may ask for relative facilities for temporary relief from the different demigods like &#346;iva, Brahm&#257;, Indra and Varu&#7751;a. No demigod, however, can release the imprisoned living being from the conditioned life of material existence. This can be done only by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Therefore, the ultimate benefit may be derived from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead.</div>

In other words, there is a qualitative difference between the different kinds of worshiping methods as well as the respective results derived from the predominating deities, namely Brahm&#257;, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u and Hara.</div>

We should never desire to increase the depth of material enjoyment. Material enjoyment should be accepted only up to the point of the bare necessities of life and not more or less than that. To accept more material enjoyment means to bind oneself more and more to the miseries of material existence. More wealth, more women and false aristocracy are some of the demands of the materially disposed man because he has no information of the benefit derived from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u worship. By Vi&#7779;&#7751;u worship one can derive benefit in this life as well as in life after death.

<div class="Translation">In the revealed scriptures, the ultimate object of knowledge is &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. The purpose of performing sacrifice is to please Him. Yoga is for realizing Him. All fruitive activities are ultimately rewarded by Him only. He is supreme knowledge, and all severe austerities are performed to know Him. Religion [dharma] is rendering loving service unto Him. He is the supreme goal of life.</div>

<div class="First">That &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead, is the only object of worship is confirmed in these two <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas.</span> In the Vedic literature there is the same objective: establishing one's relationship and ultimately reviving our lost loving service unto Him. That is the sum and substance of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the same theory is confirmed by the Lord in His own words: the ultimate purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to know Him only. All the revealed scriptures are prepared by the Lord through His incarnation in the body of &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva just to remind the fallen souls, conditioned by material nature, of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. No demigod can award freedom from material bondage. That is the verdict of all the Vedic literatures. Impersonalists who have no information of the Personality of Godhead minimize the omnipotency of the Supreme Lord and put Him on equal footing with all other living beings, and for this act such impersonalists get freedom from material bondage only with great difficulty. They can surrender unto Him only after many, many births in the culture of transcendental knowledge.</div>

<div class="Purport">One may argue that the Vedic activities are based on sacrificial ceremonies. That is true. But all such sacrifices are also meant for realizing the truth about V&#257;sudeva. Another name of V&#257;sudeva is Yaj&#241;a (sacrifice), and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is clearly stated that all sacrifices and all activities are to be conducted for the satisfaction of Yaj&#241;a, or Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Personality of Godhead. This is the case also with the <span class="Italic">yoga</span> systems. <span class="Italic">Yoga</span> means to get into touch with the Supreme Lord. The process, however, includes several bodily features such as <span class="Italic">&#257;sana, dhy&#257;na, pr&#257;&#7751;&#257;y&#257;ma</span> and meditation, and all of them are meant for concentrating upon the localized aspect of V&#257;sudeva represented as Param&#257;tm&#257;. Param&#257;tm&#257; realization is but partial realization of V&#257;sudeva, and if one is successful in that attempt, one realizes V&#257;sudeva in full. But by ill luck most <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are stranded by the powers of mysticism achieved through the bodily process. Ill-fated <span class="Italic">yog&#299;s</span> are given a chance in the next birth by being placed in the families of good learned <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> or in the families of rich merchants in order to execute the unfinished task of V&#257;sudeva realization. If such fortunate <span class="Italic">br&#257;hma&#7751;as</span> and sons of rich men properly utilize the chance, they can easily realize V&#257;sudeva by good association with saintly persons. Unfortunately, such preferred persons are captivated again by material wealth and honor, and thus they practically forget the aim of life.</div>
<A NAME="11845"></A><div id="11845"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This is also so for the culture of knowledge. According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> there are eighteen items in culturing knowledge. By such culture of knowledge one becomes gradually prideless, devoid of vanity, nonviolent, forbearing, simple, devoted to the great spiritual master, and self-controlled. By culture of knowledge one becomes unattached to hearth and home and becomes conscious of the miseries due to death, birth, old age and disease. And all culture of knowledge culminates in devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva. Therefore, V&#257;sudeva is the ultimate aim in culturing all different branches of knowledge. Culture of knowledge leading one to the transcendental plane of meeting V&#257;sudeva is real knowledge. physical knowledge in its various branches is condemned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> as <span class="Italic">aj&#241;&#257;na,</span> or the opposite of real knowledge. The ultimate aim of physical knowledge is to satisfy the senses, which means prolongation of the term of material existence and thereby continuance of the threefold miseries. So prolonging the miserable life of material existence is nescience. But the same physical knowledge leading to the way of spiritual understanding helps one to end the miserable life of physical existence and to begin the life of spiritual existence on the plane of V&#257;sudeva.</div>
<A NAME="11846"></A><div id="11846"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The same applies to all kinds of austerities. <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> means voluntary acceptance of bodily pains to achieve some higher end of life. R&#257;va&#7751;a and Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu underwent a severe type of bodily torture to achieve the end of sense gratification. Sometimes modern politicians also undergo severe types of austerities to achieve some political end. This is not actually <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> One should accept voluntary bodily inconvenience for the sake of knowing V&#257;sudeva because that is the way of real austerities. Otherwise all forms of austerities are classified as modes of passion and ignorance. passion and ignorance cannot end the miseries of life. Only the mode of goodness can mitigate the threefold miseries of life. Vasudeva and Devak&#299;, the so-called father and mother of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, underwent penances to get V&#257;sudeva as their son. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the father of all living beings (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/14/4?d=1">14.4</a>). Therefore He is the original living being of all other living beings. He is the original eternal enjoyer amongst all other enjoyers. Therefore no one can be His begetting father, as the ignorant may think. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299; upon being pleased with their severe austerities. Therefore if any austerities have to be done, they must be done to achieve the end of knowledge, V&#257;sudeva.</div>
<A NAME="11847"></A><div id="11847"> </div>
<div class="Purport">V&#257;sudeva is the original Personality of Godhead Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. As explained before, the original Personality of Godhead expands Himself by innumerable forms. Such expansion of forms is made possible by His various energies. His energies are also multifarious, and His internal energies are superior and external energies inferior in quality. They are explained in the <span class="Ref_Italic"></B>Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span></B> (<a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/7/4?d=1">7.4</a>-6) as the <span class="Italic">par&#257;</span> and the <span class="Italic">apar&#257; prak&#7771;tis.</span> So His expansions of various forms which take place via the internal energies are superior forms, whereas the expansions which take place via the external energies are inferior forms. The living entities are also His expansions. The living entities who are expanded by His internal potency are eternally liberated persons, whereas those who are expanded in terms of the material energies are eternally conditioned souls. Therefore, all culture of knowledge, austerities, sacrifice and activities should be aimed at changing the quality of the influence that is acting upon us. For the present, we are all being controlled by the external energy of the Lord, and just to change the quality of the influence, we must endeavor to cultivate spiritual energy. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that those who are <span class="Italic">mah&#257;tm&#257;s,</span> or those whose minds have been so broadened as to be engaged in the service of Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, are under the influence of the internal potency, and the effect is that such broadminded living beings are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord without deviation. That should be the aim of life. And that is the verdict of all the Vedic literatures. No one should bother himself with fruitive activities or dry speculation about transcendental knowledge. Everyone should at once engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Nor should one worship different demigods who work as different hands of the Lord for creation, maintenance or destruction of the material world. There are innumerable powerful demigods who look over the external management of the material world. They are all different assisting hands of Lord V&#257;sudeva. Even Lord &#346;iva and Lord Brahm&#257; are included in the list of demigods, but Lord Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, or V&#257;sudeva, is always transcendentally situated. Even though He accepts the quality of goodness of the material world, He is still transcendental to all the material modes. The following example will clear that matter more explicitly. In the prison house there are the prisoners and the managers of the prison house. Both the managers and the prisoners are bound by the laws of the king. But even though the king sometimes comes in the prison, he is not bound by the laws of the prison house. The king is therefore always transcendental to the laws of the prison house, as the Lord is always transcendental to the laws of the material world.</div>

As from wood, fire can be manifested, or as butter can be churned out of milk, so also the presence of the Lord as Param&#257;tm&#257; can be felt by the process of legitimate hearing and chanting of the transcendental subjects which are especially treated in the Vedic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Upani&#7779;ads</span> and <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta.</span> <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the bona fide explanation of these Vedic literatures.

As fire is kindled from wood by another fire, the divine consciousness of man can similarly be kindled by another divine grace. His Divine Grace the spiritual master can kindle the spiritual fire from the woodlike living entity by imparting proper spiritual messages injected through the receptive ear. Therefore one is required to approach the proper spiritual master with receptive ears only, and thus divine existence is gradually realized. The difference between animality and humanity lies in this process only. A human being can hear properly, whereas an animal cannot.</div>

The gross material body is based on the conditions of the subtle mind, and the senses are created according to the desire of the living being. The Lord as Param&#257;tm&#257; helps the living being to get material happiness because the living being is helpless in all respects in obtaining what he desires. He proposes, and the Lord disposes. In another sense, the living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord. They are therefore one with the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> the living beings in all varieties of bodies have been claimed by the Lord as His sons. The sufferings and enjoyments of the sons are indirectly the sufferings and enjoyments of the father. Still the father is not in any way affected directly by the suffering and enjoyment of the sons. He is so kind that He constantly remains with the living being as Param&#257;tm&#257; and always tries to convert the living being towards the real happiness.</div>

<div class="Translation">Thus the Lord of the universes maintains all planets inhabited by demigods, men and lower animals. Assuming the roles of incarnations, He performs pastimes to reclaim those in the mode of pure goodness.</div>

<A NAME="11918"></A><div id="11918"> </div>
<div class="First">There are innumerable material universes, and in each and every universe there are innumerable planets inhabited by different grades of living entities in different modes of nature. The Lord (Vi&#7779;&#7751;u) incarnates Himself in each and every one of them and in each and every type of living society. He manifests His transcendental pastimes amongst them just to create the desire to go back to Godhead. The Lord does not change His original transcendental position, but He appears to be differently manifested according to the particular time, circumstances and society.</div>
<A NAME="11919"></A><div id="11919"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Sometimes He incarnates Himself or empowers a suitable living being to act for Him, but in either case the purpose is the same: the Lord wants the suffering living being to go back home, back to Godhead. The happiness which the living beings are hankering for is not to be found within any corner of the innumerable universes and material planets. The eternal happiness which the living being wants is obtainable in the kingdom of God, but the forgetful living beings under the influence of the material modes have no information of the kingdom of God. The Lord, therefore, comes to propagate the message of the kingdom of God, either personally as an incarnation or through His bona fide representative as the good son of God. Such incarnations or sons of God are not making propaganda for going back to Godhead only within the human society. Their work is also going on in all types of societies, amongst demigods and those other than human beings.</div>
