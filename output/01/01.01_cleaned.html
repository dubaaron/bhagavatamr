I meditate upon Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahm&#257;j&#299;, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.</div>

<div class="First">Obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, V&#257;sudeva, directly indicate Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, who is the divine son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;. This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva asserts herein that &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his <span class="Italic">K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-sandarbha.</span> And Brahm&#257;, the original living being, has explained the subject of &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a substantially in his treatise named <span class="Italic">Brahma-sa&#7745;hit&#257;.</span> In the <span class="Italic">S&#257;ma-veda Upani&#7779;ad,</span> it is also stated that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the divine son of Devak&#299;. Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, which means the all-attractive. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like N&#257;rada, Vy&#257;sa, and many others. In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the principal one. V&#257;sudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with V&#257;sudeva, are indicated in this text. The name V&#257;sudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devak&#299;. &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is always meditated upon by the <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sas,</span> who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life.</div>
<A NAME="11052"></A><div id="11052"> </div>
<div class="Purport">V&#257;sudeva, or Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, is the cause of all causes. Everything that exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mah&#257;prabhu &#346;r&#299; Caitanya as the spotless <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The history of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is also very glorious. It was compiled by &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of &#346;r&#299; N&#257;radaj&#299;, his spiritual master. Vy&#257;sadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tras</span> (or the <span class="Italic">Brahma-s&#363;tras</span>), the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as,</span> the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> and so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus N&#257;rada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories.</div>
<A NAME="11053"></A><div id="11053"> </div>
<div class="Purport">It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will. Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<A NAME="11054"></A><div id="11054"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-27">In Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahm&#257;, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings. And above Brahm&#257;, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings. But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties. If a man's brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara.</span> He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the <span class="Italic">para</span> or the <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara</span> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that <span class="Italic">parame&#347;vara</span> is &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, as admitted in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and other scriptures delivered by &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva and specifically in this <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord says that there is no other <span class="Italic">para-tattva</span> (<span class="Italic">summum bonum</span>) than Himself. Therefore, &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva at once worships the <span class="Italic">para-tattva,</span> &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.</div>
<A NAME="11055"></A><div id="11055"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-28">Unscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto and especially to the five chapters which describe the Lord's <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance. This portion of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the most confidential part of this great literature. Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord's worshipable transcendental pastimes called <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance and His love affairs with the <span class="Italic">gop&#299;s.</span> This subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have gradually attained to the stage of <span class="Italic">paramaha&#7745;sa</span> can transcendentally relish this <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra, dh&#299;mahi.</span> This G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is meant for spiritually advanced people. When one is successful in chanting the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must therefore acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of goodness in order to chant the G&#257;yatr&#299; <span class="Italic">mantra</span> successfully and then attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord, His name, His fame, His qualities and so on.</div>
<A NAME="11056"></A><div id="11056"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the narration of the <span class="Italic">svar&#363;pa</span> of the Lord manifested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from the external potency which has manifested the cosmic world, which is within our experience. &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva makes a clear distinction between the two in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka.</span> &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva says herein that the manifested internal potency is real, whereas the external manifested energy in the form of material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the desert. In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahm&#257;, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia.</div>
<A NAME="11057"></A><div id="11057"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner because everything is done under his direction. He knows everything about the construction, both directly and indirectly. Similarly, the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation, knows every nook and corner, although affairs are being carried out by demigods. Beginning from Brahm&#257; down to the insignificant ant, no one is independent in the material creation. The hand of the Lord is seen everywhere. All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate from Him only. And whatever is created in this material world is but the interaction of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. But, in reality, the living entity works in the laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord. And the materials with which he works are also supplied by the Lord. The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details, and He is fully independent. He is compared to a mine of gold, and the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared to objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on. The gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different. Nothing is absolutely equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent of the Absolute Truth.</div>
<A NAME="11058"></A><div id="11058"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Conditioned souls, beginning from Brahm&#257;, who engineers the entire universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them are independent of the Supreme Lord. The materialist wrongly thinks that there is no creator other than his own self. This is called <span class="Italic">m&#257;y&#257;,</span> or illusion. Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence. This is refuted in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> by &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva: "Since the complete whole or the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, nothing can be independent of the body of the Absolute Truth." Whatever happens to the body quickly becomes known to the embodied. Similarly, the creation is the body of the absolute whole. Therefore, the Absolute knows everything directly and indirectly that happens in the creation.</div>
<A NAME="11059"></A><div id="11059"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantra,</span> it is also stated that the absolute whole or Brahman is the ultimate source of everything. Everything emanates from Him, and everything is maintained by Him. And at the end, everything enters into Him. That is the law of nature. In the <span class="Italic">sm&#7771;ti-mantra,</span> the same is confirmed. It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahm&#257;'s millennium and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth or Brahman. Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate source is explained. According to the Vedic literatures, Brahm&#257;, who may be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator. It is stated in this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka</span> that Brahm&#257; was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead. One may argue that Brahm&#257;, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time. Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahm&#257;, in order that Brahm&#257; could carry out his creative functions. So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a states that it is He only who superintends the creative energy, <span class="Italic">prak&#7771;ti,</span> which constitutes the totality of matter. Therefore, &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva does not worship Brahm&#257;, but the Supreme Lord, who guides Brahm&#257; in his creative activities. In this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> the particular words <span class="Italic">abhij�a&#7717;</span> and <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;</span> are significant. These two words distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities. No other living entity is either <span class="Italic">abhij�a&#7717;</span> or <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;.</span> That is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahm&#257; has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord are neither <span class="Italic">abhij�a&#7717;</span> or <span class="Italic">svar&#257;&#7789;.</span> Such impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like R&#257;va&#7751;a or Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them. This is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> in the well-known verse <span class="Italic">yad&#257; yad&#257; hi dharmasya gl&#257;ni&#7717;.</span> "Whenever there is a decline of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and a rise of <span class="Italic">adharma,</span> O Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself." (Bg. <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/4/7?d=1">4.7</a>)</div>
<A NAME="11060"></A><div id="11060"> </div>
<div class="Purport">That the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras.</span> It is said in the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras</span> that the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over matter and thus created all living beings. The living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to enact so many wonderful creations. An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God's further attention. If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God. But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually. Therefore, no one can create as well as God. Another name for God is <span class="Italic">asamaurdhva,</span> which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him. <span class="Italic">Para&#7745; satyam,</span> or the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras.</span> It is said that before the creation of the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of everyone. That Lord instructed Brahm&#257; in Vedic knowledge. That Lord has to be obeyed in all respects. Anyone who wants to get rid of the material entanglement must surrender unto Him. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span></div>

Anyone who makes a gift of this great work on a full moon day attains to the highest perfection of life by returning to Godhead. There is reference to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in other <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> also, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished in twelve cantos, which include eighteen thousand <span class="Italic">&#347;lokas.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Padma Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> also there is reference to the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in a conversation between Gautama and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Ambar&#299;&#7779;a.

Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal. It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life.</div>

This beautiful Bh&#257;gavatam, compiled by the great sage Vy&#257;sadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture?

<div class="First">Religion includes four primary subjects, namely pious activities, economic development, satisfaction of the senses, and finally liberation from material bondage. Irreligious life is a barbarous condition. Indeed, human life begins when religion begins. Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating are the four principles of animal life. These are common both to animals and to human beings. But religion is the extra function of the human being. Without religion, human life is no better than animal life. Therefore, in human societies there is some form of religion which aims at self-realization and which makes reference to man's eternal relationship with God.</div>
<A NAME="11079"></A><div id="11079"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the lower stages of human civilization, there is always competition to lord it over the material nature or, in other words, there is a continuous rivalry to satisfy the senses. Driven by such consciousness, man turns to religion. He thus performs pious activities or religious functions in order to gain something material. But if such material gains are obtainable in other ways, then so-called religion is neglected. This is the situation in modern civilization. Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not very interested in religion. Churches, mosques or temples are now practically vacant. Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in religious places which were erected by their forefathers. This practically proves that religion is performed for some economic gains. Economic gains are needed for sense gratification. Often when one is baffled in the pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become one with the Supreme Lord. Consequently, all these states are simply different types of sense gratification.</div>
<A NAME="11080"></A><div id="11080"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the above-mentioned four activities are prescribed in the regulative way so that there will not be any undue competition for sense gratification. But <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is transcendental to all these sense gratificatory activities. It is purely transcendental literature which can be understood only by the pure devotees of the Lord who are transcendental to competitive sense gratification. In the material world there is keen competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and community, nation and nation. But the devotees of the Lord rise above such competitions. They do not compete with the materialist because they are on the path back to Godhead where life is eternal and blissful. Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart. In the material world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is competition. But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only free from material envy, but are well-wishers to everyone, and they strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center. The contemporary socialist's conception of a competitionless society is artificial because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator. From the point of view of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> or from the point of view of common human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life. There are three paths mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> One involves fruitive activities to gain promotion to better planets. Another involves worshiping different demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and becoming one with Him.</div>
<A NAME="11081"></A><div id="11081"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-29">The impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth is not the highest. Above the impersonal feature is the Param&#257;tm&#257; feature, and above this is the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, or Bhagav&#257;n. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> gives information about the Absolute Truth in His personal feature. It is higher than impersonalist literatures and higher than the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> division of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> It is even higher than the <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> division, and even higher than the <span class="Italic">up&#257;san&#257;-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> division, because it recommends the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. In the <span class="Italic">karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a,</span> there is competition to reach heavenly planets for better sense gratification, and there is similar competition in the <span class="Italic">j�&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</span> and the <span class="Italic">up&#257;san&#257;-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a.</span> The <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is superior to all of these because it aims at the Supreme Truth which is the substance or the root of all categories. From <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> one can come to know the substance as well as the categories. The substance is the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, and all emanations are relative forms of energy.</div>
<A NAME="11082"></A><div id="11082"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Nothing is apart from the substance, but at the same time the energies are different from the substance. This conception is not contradictory. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> explicitly promulgates this simultaneously one and different philosophy of the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra,</span> which begins with the "<span class="Italic">janm&#257;dy asya</span>"<span class="Italic"></I> [SB </I><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/1/1/1?d=1">1.1.1</a></I>]</span></I> <span class="Italic">s&#363;tra.</span></div>
<A NAME="11083"></A><div id="11083"> </div>
<div class="Purport">This knowledge that the energy of the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators' attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute. When this knowledge is factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to be imperfect. Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded in the conception of simultaneously one and different leads one immediately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are (<B>1</B>) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, (<B>2</B>) those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and (<B>3</B>) those miseries arising from natural catastrophes over which one has no control. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> begins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute Person. The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute. In the material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys, and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life. But as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant, he at once becomes free from all miseries. As long as the living entity is trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming servant of the Supreme. Service to the Lord is rendered in pure consciousness of one's spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from material encumbrances.</div>

<div class="Purport">Over and above this, <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is a personal commentation on the <span class="Italic">Ved&#257;nta-s&#363;tra</span> by &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. It was written in the maturity of his spiritual life through the mercy of N&#257;rada. &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva is the authorized incarnation of N&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;a, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there is no question as to his authority. He is the author of all other Vedic literatures, yet he recommends the study of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> above all others. In other <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> there are different methods set forth by which one can worship the demigods. But in the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> only the Supreme Lord is mentioned. The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the different parts of that body. Consequently, by worshiping the Supreme Lord, one does not need to worship the demigods. The Supreme Lord becomes fixed in the heart of the devotee immediately. Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu has recommended the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> as the spotless <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;a</span> and distinguishes it from all other <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as.</span></div>

Regulated knowledge involves a gradual raising of the living entity to the spiritual platform, and the highest spiritual realization is knowledge that the Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all spiritual tastes, or <span class="Italic">rasas.</span></div>
<A NAME="11102"></A><div id="11102"> </div>
<div class="Purport"><JD:"Destination-30">Every living entity, beginning from Brahm&#257;, the first-born living being within the material world, down to the insignificant ant, desires to relish some sort of taste derived from sense perceptions. These sensual pleasures are technically called <span class="Italic">rasas.</span> Such <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are of different varieties. In the revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are enumerated: (<B>1</B>) <span class="Italic">raudra</span> (anger), (<B>2</B>) <span class="Italic">adbhuta</span> (wonder), (<B>3</B>) <span class="Italic">&#347;&#7771;&#7749;g&#257;ra</span> (conjugal love), (<B>4</B>) <span class="Italic">h&#257;sya</span> (comedy), (<B>5</B>) <span class="Italic">v&#299;ra</span> (chivalry), (<B>6</B>) <span class="Italic">day&#257;</span> (mercy), (<B>7</B>) <span class="Italic">d&#257;sya</span> (servitorship), (<B>8</B>) <span class="Italic">sakhya</span> (fraternity), (<B>9</B>) <span class="Italic">bhay&#257;naka</span> (horror), (<B>10</B>) <span class="Italic">b&#299;bhatsa</span> (shock), (<B>11</B>) <span class="Italic">&#347;&#257;nta</span> (neutrality), (<B>12</B>) <span class="Italic">v&#257;tsalya</span> (parenthood).</div>
<A NAME="11103"></A><div id="11103"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The sum total of all these <span class="Italic">rasas</span> is called affection or love. Primarily, such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, paternal affection, and conjugal love. And when these five are absent, love is present indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on. For example, when a man is in love with a woman, the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is called conjugal love. But when such love affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger, shock, or even horror. Sometimes love affairs between two persons culminate in ghastly murder scenes. Such <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are displayed between man and man and between animal and animal. There is no possibility of an exchange or <span class="Italic">rasa</span> between a man and an animal or between a man and any other species of living beings within the material world. The <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are exchanged between members of the same species. But as far as the spirit souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the <span class="Italic">rasas</span> were originally exchanged between the spiritual living being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual exchange or <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord.</div>
<A NAME="11104"></A><div id="11104"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras,</span> Vedic hymns, as "the fountainhead of all <span class="Italic">rasas.</span>" When one associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one's constitutional <span class="Italic">rasa</span> with the Lord, then the living being is actually happy.</div>
<A NAME="11105"></A><div id="11105"> </div>
<div class="Purport">These <span class="Italic">&#347;ruti-mantras</span> indicate that every living being has its constitutional position, which is endowed with a particular type of <span class="Italic">rasa</span> to be exchanged with the Personality of Godhead. In the liberated condition only, this primary <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is experienced in full. In the material existence, the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary. And thus the <span class="Italic">rasas</span> of the material world are exhibited in the material form of <span class="Italic">raudra</span> (anger) and so on.</div>
<A NAME="11106"></A><div id="11106"> </div>
<div class="Purport">Therefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different <span class="Italic">rasas,</span> which are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false representations of the original <span class="Italic">rasas</span> which are reflected in the material world. The learned scholar seeks to relish the real <span class="Italic">rasa</span> in the spiritual form. In the beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme. Thus, less intelligent transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different <span class="Italic">rasas.</span></div>
<A NAME="11107"></A><div id="11107"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this <span class="Italic">&#347;loka,</span> it is definitely stated that spiritual <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> which is relished even in the liberated stage, can be experienced in the literature of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> due to its being the ripened fruit of all Vedic knowledge. By submissively hearing this transcendental literature, one can attain the full pleasure of his heart's desire. But one must be very careful to hear the message from the right source. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is exactly received from the right source. It was brought by N&#257;rada Muni from the spiritual world and given to his disciple &#346;r&#299; Vy&#257;sadeva. The latter in turn delivered the message to his son &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, and &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; delivered the message to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;k&#7779;it just seven days before the King's death. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a liberated soul from his very birth. He was liberated even in the womb of his mother, and he did not undergo any sort of spiritual training after his birth. At birth no one is qualified, neither in the mundane nor in the spiritual sense. But &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, due to his being a perfectly liberated soul, did not have to undergo an evolutionary process for spiritual realization. Yet despite his being a completely liberated person situated in the transcendental position above the three material modes, he was attracted to this transcendental <span class="Italic">rasa</span> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is adored by liberated souls who sing Vedic hymns. The Supreme Lord's pastimes are more attractive to liberated souls than to mundane people. He is of necessity not impersonal because it is only possible to carry on transcendental <span class="Italic">rasa</span> with a person.</div>
<A NAME="11108"></A><div id="11108"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> the transcendental pastimes of the Lord are narrated, and the narration is systematically depicted by &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Thus the subject matter is appealing to all classes of persons, including those who seek liberation and those who seek to become one with the supreme whole.</div>
<A NAME="11109"></A><div id="11109"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In Sanskrit the parrot is also known as <span class="Italic">&#347;uka.</span> When a ripened fruit is cut by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced. The Vedic fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability to recite the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> exactly as he heard it from his learned father, but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to all classes of men.</div>
<A NAME="11110"></A><div id="11110"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The subject matter is so presented through the lips of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; that any sincere listener that hears submissively can at once relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes of the material world. The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from the highest planet of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;aloka. Rather, it has come down carefully through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance. Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental <span class="Italic">rasa</span> known as the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance without following in the footsteps of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcendental realization. One should be intelligent enough to know the position of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> by considering personalities like &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who deals with the subject so carefully. This process of disciplic succession of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata</span> school suggests that in the future also <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> has to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. A professional man who makes a business out of reciting the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> illegally is certainly not a representative of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;. Such a man's business is only to earn his livelihood. Therefore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men. Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject. They usually plunge into the subject matter of the <span class="Italic">r&#257;sa</span> dance, which is misunderstood by the foolish class of men. Some of them take this to be immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpretations. They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>
<A NAME="11111"></A><div id="11111"> </div>
<div class="Purport">One should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> should receive the message of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> in the chain of disciplic succession from &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who describes the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> from its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has very little knowledge in transcendental science. <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is so carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice through the mouth of &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; or his bona fide representative.</div>

Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya in the <span class="Italic">Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;&#7751;a,</span> where it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed.

Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and prosperity. However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world.

By pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts.

<div class="First">The secret of success in spiritual life is in satisfying the spiritual master and thereby getting his sincere blessings. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; &#7788;h&#257;kura has sung in his famous eight stanzas on the spiritual master as follows: "I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master. Only by his satisfaction can one please the Personality of Godhead, and when he is dissatisfied there is only havoc on the path of spiritual realization." It is essential, therefore, that a disciple be very much obedient and submissive to the bona fide spiritual master. &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; fulfilled all these qualifications as a disciple, and therefore he was endowed with all favors by his learned and self-realized spiritual masters such as &#346;r&#299;la Vy&#257;sadeva and others. The sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya were confident that &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; was bona fide. Therefore they were anxious to hear from him.</div>

<div class="First">The devotees of the Lord are always anxious for the spiritual improvement of the general public. When the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya analyzed the state of affairs of the people in this age of Kali, they foresaw that men would live short lives. In Kali-yuga, the duration of life is shortened not so much because of insufficient food but because of irregular habits. By keeping regular habits and eating simple food, any man can maintain his health. Overeating, over-sense gratification, overdependence on another's mercy, and artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of human energy. Therefore the duration of life is shortened.</div>
<A NAME="11217"></A><div id="11217"> </div>
<div class="Purport">The people of this age are also very lazy, not only materially but in the matter of self-realization. The human life is especially meant for self-realization. That is to say, man should come to know what he is, what the world is, and what the supreme truth is. Human life is a means by which the living entity can end all the miseries of the hard struggle for life in material existence and by which he can return to Godhead, his eternal home. But, due to a bad system of education, men have no desire for self-realization. Even if they come to know about it, they unfortunately become victims of misguided teachers.</div>
<A NAME="11218"></A><div id="11218"> </div>
<div class="Purport">In this age, men are victims not only of different political creeds and parties, but also of many different types of sense-gratificatory diversions, such as cinemas, sports, gambling, clubs, mundane libraries, bad association, smoking, drinking, cheating, pilfering, bickerings, and so on. Their minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements. In this age, many unscrupulous men manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions. Consequently, in the name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of mind nor health of body. The student (<span class="Italic">brahmac&#257;r&#299;</span>) communities are no longer being maintained, and householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;rama.</span> Consequently, the so-called <span class="Italic">v&#257;naprasthas</span> and <span class="Italic">sanny&#257;s&#299;s</span> who come out of such <span class="Italic">g&#7771;hastha-&#257;&#347;ramas</span> are easily deviated from the rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness. Men are no longer interested in spiritual values. Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the maintenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations and communities, and there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups. It has become very difficult, therefore, to raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society. The sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya are anxious to disentangle all fallen souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from &#346;r&#299;la S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;.</div>

<div class="First">Pure devotees of the Lord are more powerful than the waters of the sacred river Ganges. One can derive spiritual benefit out of prolonged use of the Ganges waters. But one can be sanctified at once by the mercy of a pure devotee of the Lord. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> it is said that any person, regardless of birth as <span class="Italic">&#347;&#363;dra,</span> woman, or merchant, can take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and by so doing can return to Godhead. To take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to take shelter of the pure devotees. The pure devotees whose only business is serving are honored by the names Prabhup&#257;da and Vi&#7779;&#7751;up&#257;da, which indicate such devotees to be representatives of the lotus feet of the Lord. Anyone, therefore, who takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual master can be at once purified. Such devotees of the Lord are honored equally with the Lord because they are engaged in the most confidential service of the Lord, for they deliver out of the material world the fallen souls whom the Lord wants to return home, back to Godhead. Such pure devotees are better known as vicelords according to revealed scriptures. The sincere disciple of the pure devotee considers the spiritual master equal to the Lord, but always considers himself to be a humble servant of the servant of the Lord</I> [<I>Cc.

The leaders of the people are very much anxious to live in peace and friendship, but they have no information of the simple method of hearing the glories of the Lord. On the contrary, such leaders are opposed to the propagation of the glories of the Lord. In other words, the foolish leaders want to completely deny the existence of the Lord. In the name of secular state, such leaders are enacting various plans every year. But by the insurmountable intricacies of the material nature of the Lord, all these plans for progress are being constantly frustrated. They have no eyes to see that their attempts at peace and friendship are failing. But here is the hint to get over the hurdle. If we want actual peace, we must open the road to understanding of the Supreme Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and glorify Him for His virtuous activities as they are depicted in the pages of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span></div>

<div class="First">The Personality of Godhead is never inactive as some less intelligent persons suggest. His works are magnificent and magnanimous. His creations both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all variegatedness. They are described nicely by such liberated souls as &#346;r&#299;la N&#257;rada, Vy&#257;sa, V&#257;lm&#299;ki, Devala, Asita, Madhva, &#346;r&#299; Caitanya, R&#257;m&#257;nuja, Vi&#7779;&#7751;usv&#257;m&#299;, Nimb&#257;rka, &#346;r&#299;dhara, Vi&#347;van&#257;tha, Baladeva, Bhaktivinoda, Siddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; and many other learned and self-realized souls. These creations, both material and spiritual, are full of opulence, beauty and knowledge, but the spiritual realm is more magnificent due to its being full of knowledge, bliss and eternity. The material creations are manifested for some time as perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas. They attract people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false things. Such foolish men have no information of the reality, and they take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all. But more intelligent men guided by sages like Vy&#257;sa and N&#257;rada know that the eternal kingdom of God is more delightful, larger, and eternally full of bliss and knowledge. Those who are not conversant with the activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored by the Lord in His adventures as incarnations wherein He displays the eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm. By such activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world. Some of these conditioned souls are engaged in the false enjoyment of material senses and others in simply negating their real life in the spiritual world. These less intelligent persons are known as <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s,</span> or fruitive workers, and <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s,</span> or dry mental speculators. But above these two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as <span class="Italic">s&#257;tvata,</span> or the devotee, who is busy neither with rampant material activity nor with material speculation. He is engaged in the positive service of the Lord, and thereby he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the <span class="Italic">karm&#299;s</span> and <span class="Italic">j�&#257;n&#299;s.</span></div>

<div class="First">There is a great difference between mundane stories, fiction, or history and the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The histories of the whole universe contain references to the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a,</span> the <span class="Italic">Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,</span> and the <span class="Italic">Pur&#257;&#7751;as</span> are histories of bygone ages recorded in connection with the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord and therefore remain fresh even after repeated readings. For example, anyone may read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> or the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> repeatedly throughout his whole life and yet find in them new light of information. Mundane news is static whereas transcendental news is dynamic, inasmuch as the spirit is dynamic and matter is static. Those who have developed a taste for understanding the transcendental subject matter are never tired of hearing such narrations. One is quickly satiated by mundane activities, but no one is satiated by transcendental or devotional activities. <span class="Italic">Uttama-&#347;loka</span> indicates that literature which is not meant for nescience. Mundane literature is in the mode of darkness or ignorance, whereas transcendental literature is quite different. Transcendental literature is above the mode of darkness, and its light becomes more luminous with progressive reading and realization of the transcendental subject matter. The so-called liberated persons are never satisfied by the repetition of the words <span class="Italic">aha&#7745; brahm&#257;smi.</span> Such artificial realization of Brahman becomes hackneyed, and so to relish real pleasure they turn to the narrations of the <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam.</span> Those who are not so fortunate turn to altruism and worldly philanthropy. This means the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;da philosophy is mundane, whereas the philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;</span> and <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is transcendental.</div>

<div class="First">The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, or the Personality of Godhead. The theory that a man becomes God by dint of penance and austerities is very much rampant nowadays, especially in India. Since Lord R&#257;ma, Lord K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the Personality of Godhead as indicated in revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations. This process of concocting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal. Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will display some feat of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of Godhead by popular vote. Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a was not that type of incarnation. He was actually the Personality of Godhead from the very beginning of His appearance. He appeared before His so-called mother as four-armed Vi&#7779;&#7751;u. Then, at the request of the mother, He became like a human child and at once left her for another devotee at Gokula, where He was accepted as the son of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257; M&#257;t&#257;. Similarly, &#346;r&#299; Baladeva, the counterpart of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, was also considered a human child born of another wife of &#346;r&#299; Vasudeva. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> the Lord says that His birth and deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of His birth and deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So knowledge of the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a is sufficient for liberation. In the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam,</span> the transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantos, and in the Tenth Canto His specific pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one's reading of this literature progresses. It is important to note here, however, that the Lord exhibited His divinity even from the lap of His mother, that His deeds are all superhuman (He lifted Govardhana Hill at the age of seven), and that all these acts definitely prove Him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet, due to His mystic covering, He was always accepted as an ordinary human child by His so-called father and mother and other relatives. Whenever some herculean task was performed by Him, the father and mother took it otherwise. And they remained satisfied with unflinching filial love for their son. As such, the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya describe Him as apparently resembling a human being, but actually He is the Supreme Almighty Personality of Godhead.</div>

<div class="First">This age of Kali is not at all suitable for self-realization as was Satya-yuga, the golden age, or Tret&#257;- or Dv&#257;para-yugas, the silver and copper ages. For self-realization, the people in Satya-yuga, living a lifetime of a hundred thousand years, were able to perform prolonged meditation. And in Tret&#257;-yuga, when the duration of life was ten thousand years, self-realization was attained by performance of great sacrifice. And in the Dv&#257;para-yuga, when the duration of life was one thousand years, self-realization was attained by worship of the Lord. But in the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life being one hundred years only and that combined with various difficulties, the recommended process of self-realization is that of hearing and chanting of the holy name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord. The sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya began this process in a place meant specifically for the devotees of the Lord. They prepared themselves to hear the pastimes of the Lord over a period of one thousand years. By the example of these sages one should learn that regular hearing and recitation of the <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavatam</span> is the only way for self-realization. Other attempts are simply a waste of time, for they do not give any tangible results. Lord &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu preached this system of <span class="Italic">Bh&#257;gavata-dharma,</span> and He recommended that all those who were born in India should take the responsibility of broadcasting the messages of Lord &#346;r&#299; K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, primarily the message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;.</span> And when one is well established in the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;,</span> he can take up the study of <span class="Italic">&#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam</span> for further enlightenment in self-realization.</div>

<div class="First">The age of Kali is very dangerous for the human being. Human life is simply meant for self-realization, but due to this dangerous age, men have completely forgotten the aim of life. In this age, the life span will gradually decrease. People will gradually lose their memory, finer sentiments, strength, and better qualities. A list of the anomalies for this age is given in the Twelfth Canto of this work. And so this age is very difficult for those who want to utilize this life for self-realization. The people are so busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-realization. Out of madness they frankly say that there is no need for self-realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment on our great journey towards self-realization. The whole system of education is geared to sense gratification, and if a learned man thinks it over, he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the slaughterhouses of so-called education. Learned men, therefore, must be cautious of this age, and if they at all want to cross over the dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of the sages of Naimi&#7779;&#257;ra&#7751;ya and accept &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299; or his bona fide representative as the captain of the ship.
